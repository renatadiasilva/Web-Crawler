        <titulo>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-14T14:32:29Z</data>

        <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35&#186;C and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life </corpo>

        <titulo>Rachel Dolezal's biracial appearance is "blackface," brother says  - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-14T13:20:53Z</data>
        <autor>Ray Sanchez and Ben Brumfield, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)Ezra Dolezal says he didn't know how to respond the day his adopted sister took him aside and asked him "not to blow her cover" about having a black father. On that day three years ago, he said, his sister Rachel Dolezal, 37, told him she was starting life anew in Spokane, Washington, where she's now head of the local chapter of the NAACP and chairwoman of a police oversight committee. Ezra Dolezal came to visit her from Montana, where their parents live. His adopted sister was on her way to becoming one of the most prominent faces in Spokane's black community. "She told me not to blow her cover about the fact that she had this secret life or alternate identity," Ezra Dolezal said Saturday. "She told not to tell anybody about Montana or her family over there. She said she was starting a new life ... and this one person over there was actually going to be her black father." Dolezal's race has come under question after her estranged mother claimed she is white but is "being dishonest and deceptive with her identity." Dolezal has identified herself as at least partly African-American but her Montana birth certificate states she was born to two parents who say they are Caucasian. The parents shared that document and old photos with CNN. "I kind of saw it coming," Ezra Dolezal said of the controversy. "Instead of sticking to a simple story, she's been trying to make this really complex and it finally got too big for her to handle." CNN contacted Dolezal on Saturday. She declined an on-camera interview, saying she stands by her record of service and referring CNN to a statement from the NAACP on Friday. Dolezal told CNN she would likely speak Monday night at the NAACP meeting in Spokane The Spokane Spokesman-Review, meanwhile, reported that she has framed the controversy surrounding her racial identity in the context of litigation over guardianship of her adopted brother. "We are her birth parents," Lawrence Dolezal told CNN on Friday. "We do not understand why she feels it's necessary to misrepresent her ethnicity." Rachel Dolezal grew up in what her parents called a diverse family, with friends from various ethnicities and four adopted siblings who are black. She was "always interested in ethnicity and diversity" growing up, her mother Ruthanne Dolezal said. Dolezal attended college in Mississippi, then went on to Howard University on scholarship -- not having identified herself as black then on her application because there was no such option, though people there may have assumed as much "because her portfolio of art was all African-American portraiture," her mother said. It wasn't until around 2007, her parents said, that Dolezal began identifying herself more with the African-American community, according to her mother. Her parents say Rachel Dolezal "has chosen to distance herself from the family." According to court documents obtained by CNN, Rachel Dolezal's adopted brother, Izaiah -- who is black -- sought emancipation from Ruthanne and Lawrence Dolezal in 2010. The adopted brother, now 21, said the Dolezals used "physical forms of punishment" and had sent his brother and sister away to group homes because they didn't cooperate with the couple's religion and rules.  The adopted brother wanted to live with Rachel Dolezal "in a multiracial household where black culture is celebrated and I have a connection to the black community," the court papers said. The papers did not specify Rachel Dolezal's race. Ezra Dolezal said the accusations of physical punishment were false. They divided the family. He said he never confronted his adopted sister when she asked him not to blow her cover because he didn't want to make the situation worse. His adopted sister was always interested in African-American culture but it wasn't until about 2011 that he started to notice physical changes. "There was the gradual darkening of the skin and the hair," he said. "She started molding herself into who she is today." He said Dolezal's transformation was tantamount to living in "blackface." "It's kind of a slap in the face to African-Americans because she doesn't know what it's like to be black," said Ezra Dolezal, whose biological mother was white and father half-black. "She's only been African-American when it benefited her. She hasn't been through all the struggles. She's only been African-American the last few years." Izaiah's petition for emancipation was dropped. In a separate legal action in 2010, the court appointed Rachel Dolezal to be the adopted brother's guardian with the consent of Ruthanne and Lawrence Dolezal. Ezra Dolezal said he admires his adopted sister's appreciation and advocacy for the black community and culture. But he questions her handling of the race issue. "I believe that the first most important thing regardless of what a person does is that they have integrity," he said. "Rachel has done really good work fighting against racism and police brutality ... but she went about it the wrong way. She said I was born black. I grew up black and I know what it's like growing up as an African-American in this world. She does not." Dolezal's time at predominantly black Howard University may have been a major turning point in her transformation, her adopted brother said. "When she applied they thought she was a black student," he said. "When she came there, they saw she was white and she wasn't treated that well, especially by people that worked there. She probably started developing this kind of dislike for being white and dislike for white people. She used to tell Izaiah ... that all white people are racists. She might have developed some self-hatred." On Friday, the Dolezals told CNN they didn't want to comment on a possible "legal dispute" that their daughter and the NAACP had mentioned. One organization that appears to be standing behind her is the NAACP. The group, historically one of the most prominent in supporting causes important to the African-American community, said that Dolezal is "enduring a legal issue with her family" and that "we respect her privacy in this matter." "One's racial identity is not a qualifying criteria or disqualifying standard for NAACP leadership," the group said. "The NAACP Alaska-Oregon-Washington State Conference stands behind Ms. Dolezal's advocacy record."  Dolezal allegedly represented herself as African-American -- along with several other ethnicities, including white and Native American -- in an application for a Spokane police ombudsman commission. And she has presented the public with a different family photograph posted to the local NAACP chapter's Facebook page. When she announced her father was coming to town for a visit, she showed herself standing next to an older African-American man. Dolezal's public racial identity came under scrutiny on Thursday, when a reporter from CNN affiliate KXLY held up that photo and asked her if it showed her dad. She replied that it did. Then came a follow-up question: "Are you African-American?" "I don't understand the question of -- I did tell you that, yes, that's my dad. And he was unable to come in January," Dolezal responded. "Are your parents -- are they white?" came the next query. Dolezal walked away from the microphone, leaving her purse and keys, and took refuge in a nearby clothing boutique.  Dolezal has built a wide-ranging career as an expert on and advocate for the black community. She is not just president of her local NAACP chapter; she is also an academic expert on African-American culture and teaches many related classes at Eastern Washington University. She represents the black community publicly and vocally, including as a spokeswoman on race-influenced police violence. On Tuesday she spoke to Al Jazeera on the topic. And Dolezal has appeared alongside Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, who has filed charges against police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, a young black man. The mayor of Spokane appointed Dolezal chairwoman of a police oversight committee to keep an eye on fairness in police work. After the allegations of faked racial identity surfaced, Mayor David Condon and City Council President Ben Stuckart said they take "very seriously the concerns raised regarding the chair of the independent citizen police ombudsman commission." The city is checking to see if she has violated any policies. Still, what Dolezal has done is more important than what race she is to the NAACP, regional President Gerald Hankerson said. He called the NAACP a civil rights organization first that includes "leaders from all different ethnicities," adding that it "doesn't do a genealogy search on what a person's ethnicity is when they" take a top position. As to Dolezal specifically, Hankerson said, "We represent all civil rights issues, regardless of a person's ethnicity. And the quality of the work that she has done to elevate the issues of civil rights in that region is what we applaud."

        <corpo>(CNN)A firearm accidentally discharged during a weekend wedding at the Waldorf Astoria in New York, authorities said. Guests were taking pictures at a lobby when the gun went off Saturday night, CNN affiliate WABC reported. It was in the pocket of a 42-year-old guest when it went off, grazing a woman in the head when the bullet ricocheted. She was not seriously injured, the affiliate reported. Four others were injured when they were hit by shattered glass or debris, and treated at local hospitals, according to the affiliate. The guest carrying the gun was detained and questioned by police, according to the affiliate, but it is unclear whether he will face charges. The Waldorf Astoria allowed the couple to continue with the wedding ceremony, but asked guests to leave after 10 p.m., WABC said. The hotel said it is cooperating with investigators. "The safety and security of our guests and team members are the hotel's top priorities," Waldorf Astoria said in a statement. The Waldorf is a cultural icon and has hosted foreign heads of state for years. It was featured in a 1945 film, "Week-end at the Waldorf." </corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)North Korea test-fired three short-range anti-ship missiles off its east coast on Sunday, a South Korean defense official told CNN. "North Korea on June 14 fired three KN-01 missiles near North Korea's eastern city towards sea off east of the peninsula," the South Korean Defense Ministry official said. The missiles were reportedly fired between 4:21 p.m. and 4:47 p.m. (3:21 a.m. to 3:47 a.m. ET), according to South Korea. "The missile test follows the one from February and May," the official said. "Our military is closely monitoring North Korea's movement and is maintaining all military readiness posture for any provocation." According to globalsecurity.org, the KN-01 sufface-to-surface missile has a range of 120 kilometers, about 75 miles. North Korea first test-fired such missiles years ago, at least according to reports from the South Korean government. The Global Security website quotes the South Korean Ministry of Defense as saying that North Korea conducted "10 test launches of its KN-01 anti-ship cruise missile between February 2003 and June 2007." </corpo>

        <titulo>Dallas police HQ attack: Suspect bought van from eBay  - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>(CNN)A man who opened fire outside the Dallas police headquarters bought his armored van on eBay this month and took a bus to Georgia to pick it up, his father said. The man, who identified himself as James Boulware, was later shot dead by a sniper early Saturday after a standoff that lasted hours. He purchased his van from Newnan, Georgia, which is about 35 miles southwest of Atlanta. "He just got the van last week," said Dallas-area resident Jim Boulware, who told CNN that police and FBI agents came to his house Sunday to tell him that his son, James, was dead. "He went and took a bus to Georgia and picked it up." The gunman unleashed a barrage of gunfire on Dallas police headquarters and police said he planted explosives outside the building early Saturday. He then led police on a chase that ended at a restaurant parking lot in a suburb.  Authorities confronted the man outside the Jack in the Box restaurant in the suburb of Hutchins. He made more threats, and police shot him through the windshield of the van. The suspect had told police that the van contained explosives, prompting them to call a bomb squad to inspect it. "We believe this suspect meant to kill officers," Police Chief David Brown said. "We barely survived the intentions of this suspect."  Before he was shot, the suspect ranted to police by phone, identifying himself as James Boulware and saying that police were responsible for having his child taken from him, Brown said. Police have said that they couldn't confirm that was the suspect's real name. Jim Boulware said he thought his son would direct his anger to his mother, who was granted custody of James Boulware's son in April. James Boulware visited the home a few hours before the shooting, his father said, and police wanted to search the house.  The attack began shortly after midnight. The man fired an assault weapon and then a shotgun, riddling police cars with bullets, as well as windows of the police headquarters. Dallas Deputy Police Chief Gilberto Garza said the suspect was sometimes on foot as he fired an automatic rifle. "He was always in or just outside his van," the deputy chief said. In addition to unleashing his fusillade of bullets, Brown said, the attacker planted at least one set of pipe bombs in a bag outside. Police returned fire and gave chase. But Brown said investigators have no reason to believe the suspect had "any nexus to terrorism."  After the shootout at police headquarters, the suspect called 911 and ranted for about five minutes, accusing police of being responsible for him losing custody of a child, Brown said. Police called him back, eventually allowing SWAT officers to negotiate. Officers pursued the van to the parking lot in Hutchins,13 miles southeast of the Dallas police headquarters. The man opened the door of his van and shot at police again, and grew increasingly hostile and agitated when called on the phone. To ensure that he did not drive away and threaten anyone else, Brown said, police shot through the engine block of the van, disabling it. The man became angry and claimed the van contained C-4 plastic explosives, according to Brown. Then he cut off negotiations. That's when SWAT snipers shot him through the windshield.

        <titulo>New York prison break: Convicts rehearsed their escape - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Two murderers meticulously planned their New York state prison break, possibly sneaking out of their cells under the cover of darkness to rehearse their escape in tunnels, authorities said. Richard Matt and David Sweat planned to drive seven hours in the night to a predetermined location, together with the woman who allegedly helped them, said Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie. But Joyce Mitchell, who allegedly provided them with the tools to cut through prison walls, got cold feet and decided not to pick them up, he said. Mitchell told investigators she planned to run off with the men after picking them up last week near a manhole where they'd emerge from a network of tunnels, Wylie said. "They were going to meet down by the power plant, drive -- I'm not going to say into the sunset, because it was after midnight and it was dark out -- but they were going to drive, potentially to an area that was about seven hours away," Wylie said. But she backed out.  Mitchell told authorities that Matt and Sweat picked the destination. She did not say where the trio planned to head to after the two prisoners broke out of Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, officials said. "That was the information that she was told by Matt and Sweat -- that it was about seven hours away," Wylie said. After her change of heart, she began cooperating with police. "Joyce Mitchell ditched the plan to pick up the two inmates partly because she loves her husband and she didn't want to do this to him," Wylie said. She is now sitting in jail, accused of aiding in the brazen prison escape. The two convicted killers she allegedly helped are free, but on the run. She pleaded not guilty Friday night to a felony charge of promoting prison contraband and a misdemeanor charge of criminal facilitation. Her next court appearance is Monday. If convicted, Mitchell faces up to eight years behind bars.  Interviews with prison inmates indicated that Matt and Sweat were seen with cell phones before they escaped, according to Wylie. "But we have no proof of these cell phones," he said. Wylie said authorities have been in contact with relatives and friends of Matt and Sweat who live elsewhere in the United States, but all of them said they hadn't heard from the convicts since they broke out of their maximum-security cells.  Matt and Sweat were discovered missing on June 6 during a 5:30 a.m. bed check at Clinton Correctional Facility. While making their escape, they slipped through holes and cut into a steel plate and a steam pipe, then got out through the manhole and onto the street. Mitchell supplied them with hacksaw blades, chisels, a punch and a screwdriver bit, according to court records. In the weeks leading up to the escape, Wylie said, they may have been sneaking into the wall in the middle of the night to plan their escape route. And, he said, the manipulation of Mitchell may go as far back as 2013, when the trio met. Mitchell has told investigators that Matt made her feel "special," a source familiar with the investigation said. Her husband and prison co-worker, Lyle Mitchell, is also under investigation, but has not been arrested or charged, authorities said. He worked in the maintenance department at the tailoring block where his wife was employed, Wylie said. State Department of Corrections officials had received a complaint about the relationship between Joyce Mitchell and one of the two escapees. The department didn't find enough evidence to support the complaint, but that does not mean there was no relationship, Wylie said.  More than 800 state, local and federal law enforcement officers are searching for the escapees, New York State Police said. They have been following more than 700 leads developed in the weeklong manhunt. Sweat was serving a life sentence with no chance of parole for the murder of a Broome County sheriff's deputy in 2002. Matt was sentenced to 25 years to life for the kidnapping and murder of a man in 1997. The manhunt for the convicts has expanded in Plattsburgh, in upstate New York, where authorities have shut a portion of state Route 374. Tracking dogs picked up their scent last week at a gas station in the town, where authorities believe they were rummaging through trash at a sandwich shop. Wylie said earlier sightings have not led to any new clues. </corpo>

        <corpo>Seoul, South Korea (CNN)Seven new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS virus, have been confirmed in South Korea, the country's Ministry of Health said Sunday. Fourteen people died from the virus, 10 have recovered after being infected and 121 are under treatment, the ministry said. Health officials this weekend said the outbreak was slowing, but additional cases were expected. Exactly a month ago, a South Korean man walked into a hospital complaining of a cough and fever. The 68-year-old patient, who had just returned from four Middle Eastern countries, went from facility to facility before getting properly diagnosed. He would become "patient zero" of the country's outbreak. The outbreak has sparked international concern, shuttered more than 3,000 schools and stalled the country's economy. Health officials have said this week is crucial in the battle to contain MERS, as many of those in quarantine are near the end of their mandatory isolation period. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Kevin Wang contributed to this report from Atlanta. Sol Han contributed to this report from Hong Kong.</corpo>

        <corpo>London (CNN)Queen Elizabeth II marked her official birthday Saturday with a spectacular military parade and awards for actors, sportsmen and sportswomen, business leaders and community workers. The queen's actual birthday is on April 21 -- when the British monarch this year turned 89. But in line with tradition, her birthday is also celebrated on a summer Saturday when the weather is likely to be better for the parade, known as Trooping the Colour. The queen was joined by her husband, Prince Philip, and other members of the royal family for the ceremony in central London, led this year by the Welsh Guards. After the parade, the queen joined other members of the royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for a flypast by the Royal Air Force. At that point, Prince George, now a month from his second birthday, stole the show as he made his first balcony appearance in the arms of his father, Prince William. His mother, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, earlier made her first public appearance since the birth of Princess Charlotte on May 2, riding in a carriage with Prince Harry and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The queen's first Trooping the Colour was in 1953, shortly after her coronation. The queen also makes use of her official birthday to award honors to members of the public for their service to the nation. This year, recipients in the public eye include U.S. actor and director Kevin Spacey, recognized for his contribution over a decade as artistic director of the Old Vic theater in London; actor and charity fundraiser Lenny Henry; and Northern Irish musician Van Morrison. Another to be honored is journalist Caroline Criado-Perez, who in 2013 petitioned to have women displayed on British banknotes, prompting a storm of Twitter abuse. </corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)It's the stuff of modern-day fairy tales. A handsome Swedish prince is marrying his Cinderella on Saturday -- only this time, his bride-to-be is a former model and reality-TV star-turned-charity organizer. Prince Carl Philip, 36, who is third in line to the Swedish throne, will wed Sofia Hellqvist in the Royal Chapel at the Royal Palace of Stockholm. Swedish media reports have made much of 30-year-old Hellqvist's decidedly nontraditional past, including her appearance on the Swedish edition of reality TV show "Paradise Hotel" in 2005 and a reportedly risque photo shoot for Swedish men's magazine "Slitz." Hellqvist subsequently pursued business-related studies in New York and, while there, also qualified as a yoga instructor. She has more recently focused her efforts on charitable work. In 2010, she jointly founded the nonprofit organization Project Playground, which helps vulnerable children and young people in South Africa's townships. She remains honorary chairwoman of the charity, which also counts Prince Carl Philip as an honorary board member. To mark their wedding, the prince and Hellqvist have set up their own joint charitable venture, the Prince Couple's Foundation, again intended to help disadvantaged children, according to a palace news release. The guest list for the wedding includes royals from a half-dozen European nations and Princess Takamado of Japan. The wedding celebrations began with a private dinner for guests on Friday. After the ceremony on Saturday, guests will enjoy a banquet and dancing at the palace. The couple's engagement was announced in June last year. "We are looking forward to a summer wedding in the middle of June, when Sweden is extremely beautiful," they were quoted as saying then in a press release from the palace. "This will be a big day for us, and we are absolutely delighted." </corpo>

        <titulo>Actor John Stamos of 'Full House' fame arrested on DUI - CNN.com</titulo>

        <autor>Joe Sutton, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)John Stamos -- the Hollywood heartthrob known for his roles on "Full House" and "ER" -- was pulled over in Beverly Hills, California, then taken to a nearby hospital where he was arrested for having allegedly driven under the influence, police said. Police got involved after getting numerous calls about a possible drunken driver, Beverly Hills police Sgt. David Armour said. The 51-year-old actor -- the only person in his vehicle -- was pulled over, after which he showed officers his driver's license and identified himself verbally. Paramedics transported him to an area hospital due to a possible medical condition, according to Armour. Once at the hospital, authorities came to the conclusion that he'd been driving under the influence and arrested him, the police sergeant said. Stamos was given a citation for DUI and released to the care of the hospital. According to Armour, Stamos is set to appear in court September 11 in connection with the incident. While he didn't comment on the DUI allegation, the actor did tweet Saturday that he'd been released from custody and the hospital. "Thanks to everyone for their love &amp; support," Stamos wrote. "I'm home &amp; well. Very appreciative of the (Beverly Hills police) &amp; Cedars (hospital) for their care." Since his first role on the soap opera "General Hospital" in 1983, Stamos has been a mainstay in Hollywood. He held one-time and recurring roles in a number of TV shows before his big break playing "Uncle Jesse" on the sitcom "Full House" alongside the Olsen twins and Bob Saget, Stamos has kept very busy since that show went off the air in 1995, including roles in the TV series "Thieves," "Jake in Progress," "ER," and "Necessary Roughness." And he is set to star in the upcoming Fox series "Grandfathered," according to the Internet Movie Database. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Wild animals roamed the streets of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, on Sunday, after raging floodwaters damaged the city's zoo and set many of the animals free. Eight people were killed by the flooding, several others were missing, and wolves, bears, big cats and even a hippopotamus were wandering the streets of the city, according to Civil.ge, a news agency funded by the EU and the UN.  Of the zoo's 600 residents, including fish and birds, about half were missing on Sunday, theTbilisi Zoo said. Some animals have been recaptured, Civil.ge reported. Others have been killed. But some animals were still on the lam. Video from the city shows what appears to be a crocodile slithering down the city streets, as well as a hippopotamus standing around looking confused. Also among the escapees were lions, tigers, bears and wolves, the agency reported. Georgia's Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili asked residents to stay home while the animals are rounded up. The Ministry of Internal Affairs also urged everyone to stay indoors but said in a statement that the situation was "under full control." All efforts are being made to find the animals quickly, "give them injections," and get them back into the zoo, the ministry said. Two employees of the zoo were among the fatalities.  The problems began before midnight Saturday. Heavy rainfall turned the Vere River, normally little more than a stream through the center of Tbilisi, into a torrent, the news agency reported. The raging river flooded significant portions of a highway, swept away cars and at least one small house, and flooded many other homes. Images on Tbilisi City Hall's Facebook page showed roads washed out, hillsides collapsed and vehicles tossed about like toys. Rescue workers carried people on their shoulders through waist-high water. Police used a helicopter to evacuate 16 people from Akhaldaba, just west of Tbilisi, where heavy rain had damaged roads. </corpo>

        <titulo> African bees are all the buzz -- for positive reasons  - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)Africanized bees, known as "killer bees," once gained notoriety in the United States for swarming and killing. But while Africa's bees tend to be more aggressive than their European or American counterparts, their aggression also makes them more productive and resilient. Scientists in Nairobi are working to utilize the African bee and its aggression to the continent's advantage. "We have found in our previous studies that bees in Africa are a bit resistant, they are resilient to the bee pests," said Dr. Suresh Raina, the founder and principal research scientist at the African Reference Laboratory for Bee Health. He calls the quality a "novel resistance mechanism," and his team is selectively breeding bees that exhibit this quality to create a strong base of bees in Africa.  In a laboratory in Nairobi, a scientist collects the semen from male drone bees, squeezing their thoraxes and killing them in the process. Twelve male drone bees will die to artificially inseminate one queen bee. She puts the queen in a plastic tube, attached to carbon dioxide gas. The gas sends the queen to sleep, temporarily paralyzing her. Once the bee is asleep, the scientist opens up the bee's vaginal canal and drops the semen into it. The bees that will come from this queen will be less hostile to humans than this typical strain of African bee, and more productive and more resistant to disease.  While Africa has been spared by the mass bee losses occurring in the United States and Europe, with less advanced food security systems, Africa's scientists say they need to act proactively. "Bees are dying and countries are having shortages of pollinators, even in the United States," Raina said. "We thought, suppose if that disease occurred in Africa. What will happen to the food security system here?"  Around 70% of what the world consumes is dependent on bees for pollination. But with a population that is predicted to double by 2050, African farmers will have to provide for a larger -- and wealthier population. Scientists have no intention of bringing African bees to the struggling bee populations in the United States or Europe. "You don't want to cross one variety with another one and it will cause a disaster," Raina said. Still, studies from the laboratory may give some answers to some of the world's declining bee populations. Scientists are working on a bio pesticide made of a locally sourced plant extract that may help combat the Varroa mite, a parasite that contributes to death of bees in the United States. And while the research is still out, the signs are positive. </corpo>

        <titulo>Mount Kinabalu: 4 fined released for taking nude photos - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Four foreign hikers who posed naked on Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia were freed Friday after they were fined and sentenced to time served. The backpackers -- from Britain, Canada and the Netherlands -- were arrested after stripping naked May 30 and posing for photos on the mountaintop, the nation's Bernama news agency reported. The mountain is considered sacred in Malaysia. They had pleaded guilty to "committing an obscene act." CNN has verified the identity of the two Canadians as Lindsey and Danielle Peterson. The Briton is named Eleanor Hawkins. The name of the Dutchman has not yet been confirmed by CNN.  The court in Kota Kinabalu on Friday evening fined the four 5,000 Malaysian ringgits, about $1,332, each and sentenced them to three days in prison. Taking into account the time served already, the court ordered them freed. Local residents had said their behavior caused the Kota Kinabalu earthquake this month, which killed 16 people. The indigenous people of Sabah believe the tourists disrespected local culture and angered the spirit of the mountain, Bernama reported. Among those who appeared in court was a British citizen who was arrested at the airport this week as she was about to leave for the capital of Kuala Lumpur. The other three turned themselves in. They could have faced three months in prison.  It is not the first time tourists have made headlines for stripping off their clothes at major attractions. Cambodia deported two U.S. tourists for allegedly taking nude pictures at Angkor Archaeological Park after a string of nudity-related incidents hit the religious sites this year. At least eight tourists were detained last year in separate incidents for getting naked and posing for photos in Machu Picchu, the 15th-century attraction in Peru.

        <titulo>MH370 possibly plunged straight into ocean, expert says - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-12T17:01:27Z</data>
        <autor>Michael Martinez and Don Melvin, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)It has been 15 months since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing did an unexplained about-face, flew in the wrong direction and disappeared without a trace with 239 souls on board. In the absence of physical evidence, theories on what happened to the plane continue to proliferate: The crew passed out. It was pilot suicide. Or was it a paranormal event? Now comes the latest contribution to the debate: This week, a mathematician from Texas A&amp;M University announced that he had run data through a computer and determined it was likely the plane had plunged vertically into the ocean. Goong Chen, using "applied mathematics, computational fluid dynamics and numerical simulations of a Boeing 777 in a classic 'water entry' problem," determined that a plane that piercing vertically into the sea would not break apart. Simply put, a plane hitting the water at an angle would scatter its parts across the surface of the water. But one hitting at a near-vertical angle would shoot into the water with minimal damage and zoom straight to the bottom. Never mind that the Indian Ocean is more than seven times the size of the United States -- a rather large area to search. The theory of the vertical dive, said Chen and his colleagues, explains why no debris has been found. The study was published in the April 2015 issue of Notices of the American Mathematical Society. Chen offers no theories on why the plane might have been in a vertical descent. And he does offer a caveat. "The true final moments of MH370 are likely to remain a mystery until someday when its black box is finally recovered and decoded," he writes. But that has not stopped theories to sprout like weeds in an untended garden. Among those that have been circulated:  Some speculation has centered on the so-called "zombie theory" advanced by aviation specialist Clive Irving of The Daily Beast. A ghost plane is one where everyone aboard -- pilots, crew, passengers -- loses consciousness because of a loss of pressurization, an explosion, smoke or fumes. Under this supposition, the Malaysia plane continued to fly for hours on autopilot until it ran out of fuel. In 1999, a Lear jet carrying professional golfer Payne Stewart and four others crashed in South Dakota after flying on its own for four hours. All aboard had died when the cabin lost pressure. "I think in the first few minutes of this emergency, the pilots had to change course because they were looking for an emergency airport," Irving said about the Malaysian flight. "They were at some point overtaken by whatever it was, smoke, fire, or some kind of problem. And the plane was then left to fly itself after it had been programmed to go on that course." CNN aviation analyst Les Abend considers the thesis "very viable." "It can happen insidiously if it's a slow situation," Abend said. "But my scenario is a smoldering fire that created smoke and once that smoke began the crew donned their oxygen masks." The plane's captain may have "realized it was compelling enough to get the airplane turned and entered a waypoint that was an alternate airport in the flight management computer and kept the autopilot connected because this plane is designed, especially in an emergency situation to reduce workload," Abend said.  The crew may have become incapacitated and unable to land the plane, said former pilot Alastair Rosenschein, causing the plane to crash in the south Indian Ocean, where numerous searches have taken place. With the crew incapacitated, none of the passengers would have had the ability to control the plane or issue a distress call. If the plane ran out of fuel while on autopilot, the landing at sea would have the same path as one on land, said Mitchell Casado, a Boeing 777 pilot trainer. "It's not going to be any dramatic nose down or turning or anything like that. It's just going to be a very gentle, gradual descent -- very similar, actually, to what you would experience in a regular flight," Casado said. "Just a very gradual descent but constant until you hit the ground."  Malaysian military radar registered dramatic altitude changes for Flight 370 -- rising to 45,000 feet and then descending to 23,000 feet -- as it moved across Malaysia, according to a senior U.S. official. The official cautioned that the readings are not believed entirely accurate. Still, analysts surmise causes for the altitude changes. "Some of the flight profile changes might suggest that the flight was commandeered," said Robert Goyer, editor-in-chief of Flying magazine and a commercial jet-rated pilot. "Was it by one of the pilots or by an intruder? It would be more likely that it was ... by one of the pilots."  Inevitably, attention turns to whether the pilot or co-pilot tried to destroy the aircraft. Those theories can only grow more insistent in the wake of the crash of a Germanwings plane in the French alps earlier this year, in which the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, is believed to have downed the plane deliberately in a mass murder-suicide. Among the disturbing circumstances of MH370's disappearance is that its transponder and communication systems were off shortly after takeoff. Some experts have advanced the possibility that the pilots or crew were bent on the annihilation of everyone aboard the plane. "It's my belief that there was probably some type of struggle in the cockpit where it was one of the pilots that maybe had a meltdown or did something nefarious to the airplane," said Mark Weiss, a retired American Airlines pilot captain who has flown the Boeing 777.  Some Internet users have ventured into the bizarre and paranormal. Some assert a meteor struck the plane. But the astronomical odds against such an event are high, to put it mildly. Lisa Williams, a psychic in California, said she believed the plane went down somewhere with its passengers still alive, though she doesn't have proof. "I do believe that it actually crashed and I see a lot of trees . . . " Williams said. "I also believe there was a hijacking." But Abend, the aviation analyst, dismissed Williams' speculation. "With(out) disparaging Lisa's profession, I mean, listen, I'm an airline pilot. I deal in black and white," Abend said. "It's difficult for me to, in this particular circumstance, to think that a psychic could solve a problem that people all over the world are not able to solve at this point." Underwater search for MH370 could end next year CNN's Tom Watkins and Matt Smith contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>Boko Haram victim: I'll keep my captor's baby - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Um Haleema was just 16 years old when she was kidnapped. Her first few months in captivity, at the hands of militant group Boko Haram, were enough to break anyone's spirit -- let alone that of a teenage girl so far from home. She was captured trying to escape, along with three of her friends, as Boko Haram burned and ransacked her village. During her captivity, Um Haleema was forced to watch men, women and children slaughtered. She was forced into marriage. Forced to wait on a "husband" she hated. But while she watched, she says she was also waiting -- for a chance to break free. And after six long months, it finally came. "I had planned my escape from the beginning," she says. "There was a time my husband spent two weeks away, so I attempted to escape but guards returned me and beat me." Eventually, her captors' vigilance began to slip and she managed to escape. In her fear, all she remembers is walking for what felt like days until she finally reached safety. She arrived home to discover that her father had been killed by the same Boko Haram militants who had held her captive for almost a year. She also found she had become pregnant by her Boko Haram husband. Now, seven months along in her pregnancy, she has agreed to speak to CNN on the condition that we conceal her identity and change her name. She doesn't want to become the face of a growing crisis -- girls and women brutally victimized by Boko Haram. The fear, she says, is still with her. This time, though, it's the men in her own community she is scared of. "People in this village are rejecting me because of the pregnancy," she says. "Some will be happy to have me dead. Many people are even saying that I should go for an abortion." It's an option she refuses to contemplate, even though she says local men have let it be known they will not tolerate the children of Boko Haram living amongst them. She says they have threatened to kill both her and her baby. There are no exact figures, but aid agencies and government officials have told CNN that an alarming percentage of girls rescued from Boko Haram have returned pregnant. The UNFPA, which is working in camps for Nigeria's internally displaced, reports that 214 women in the camps are visibly pregnant, but it is still assessing how many got pregnant while being held by Boko Haram, and if there are still more in the earlier stages of pregnancy. "We do not know yet the total number of pregnant girls among those rescued," said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a report. "The screening is still ongoing." UNFPA said it is working to meet the medical, physical and psychological needs of the freed women. In recent months, Nigeria's military has raided several Boko Haram bases freeing captive women and children. In late April to early May, about 700 women and girls were rescued in separate operations. On hearing that her daughter had been abducted, Um Haleema's mother says she immediately feared the worst. "Anybody captured by Boko Haram is presumed dead," she explains. "They abducted my step-daughter&#8206; and my daughter. They took a total of seven girls from this house." She says she has heard of many mothers who felt that abortion was the only option they had, but insists it's not a risk she's willing to take with her daughter. "We heard about one girl who died after she attempted an abortion, losing both the mother and the baby," she says. "The girl was the only child to her mother, so that scared us. If God wishes, she will give birth safely. Life is in the hands of God alone." Boko Haram: A bloody insurgency, a growing challenge CNN spoke to the men Um Haleema accused of threatening her in her village. Part of a local vigilante group, they denied making the threats. The vigilante groups in the north of Nigeria -- men who take up arms to protect their communities from Boko Haram -- have long been used by the Nigerian government in an auxiliary capacity to fight against the militants. Their leader agreed to speak CNN. "I am not aware of any woman in this village who was impregnated by them," he said. "If any woman is found to be pregnant, in our tradition, the pregnancy is considered Haram (unlawful), hence we cannot accept them wholeheartedly because they can be like baby snakes." In Muslim communities, pregnancy outside of marriage is often seen as illegitimate, unless the mother can prove it was against her will. When the interview ended and the camera stopped rolling, the vigilante leader said that his group didn't believe Um Haleema had been forced into marriage and said that she and her unborn child will always be viewed with suspicion. But he refused to comment on what he and his men might do about it. Regardless of what others say, surviving both abduction and escape has made Um Haleema realize that she has the strength to see this through. Her child, she says, deserves to live.

        <corpo>(CNN)Thousands of migrants have been fleeing Africa, risking their lives at sea for a new start in southern Europe. However, many of their boats aren't fit for the trip, and the results can be deadly. But what exactly happens to the migrants who were able to survive their journey? Photographer Sofie Amalie Klougart's "Reaching Europe" series documents the conditions some migrants face after arriving on the Italian coast of Sicily, at a migrant reception center in Pozzallo. "There is a lot of news photography of migrants arriving in Europe and about the boat tragedies, but not many pictures of how the life in Europe is and how the system is from within," Klougart said. As of June 9, the International Organization for Migration estimates that 102,000 migrants have traveled to Europe by sea this year, and 47,449 migrants have traveled to Italy between January to May -- slight increases when compared to this same time period in 2014. Klougart -- who took the photos in April -- worked with journalist Marie Louise Albers, and their documentation was supported by the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders. The subjects in "Reaching Europe" are young men from West Africa -- from countries such as Mali, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau -- who left their homes and made their way to the ports of Libya, where they continued on a treacherous journey by boat to Italy. Migrants leave their native countries for a number of reasons, including war and conflict, social or religious persecution, and a lack of employment and opportunities. What "Reaching Europe" ultimately reveals is that while the migrants Klougart documented were fortunate to have survived their journey at sea, the challenges they face do not wash away once they are on land. By the time Klougart and Albers arrived, the migrants they met had already been at the reception center for 13 days. Not only did each migrant have to wear the same clothes they were given on their initial arrival for those 13 days -- more than the typical four-day period at this specific temporary reception center -- they were never allowed to go outdoors for the duration of their stay. "There is actually nothing to do in the center," Klougart said. "And that means that even though there would be a (soccer ball) there, they wouldn't play around because they are afraid. And even though (some of the migrants) of course have a lot of energy, they cannot use it." Klougart notes that a lot of the migrants do not have energy, and instead find themselves having trouble sleeping. They appear to be in a "state of dizziness" during the day, she said. Klougart also saw a "massive" police presence, which she feels is reminiscent of a prison and could make the migrants "feel like they have committed a crime." "There were around 20 policemen just watching the migrants. ... I thought it was very uncomfortable," Klougart said. "(The policemen) were not in the same room, but, for instance, the first thing (the migrants) saw when they arrived (were) big police cars." Klougart's use of natural light throughout "Reaching Europe" serves to place a spotlight on each of her subjects and transforms them to being viewed not as migrants, but as "strong human beings." "Why shouldn't we treat these people with the same respect that we do with pop stars and politicians? Of course, (migrants) also have the right to be photographed with respect," Klougart said. "The light in these pictures is so beautiful and helps in that way. You see all (their) beautiful faces and then you realize what it is all about, that it's not just news photography." Klougart also notes that while her use of natural light was of importance to her photos, the sunlight likely had a much larger significance to the migrants personally. This is perhaps evident in photo No. 7 in the gallery above: Three young migrants are sitting in a room as sunlight emanates through the windows and ceiling. "The (migrants) were often sitting on plastic chairs (by a) little stream of sunlight that came through the window," Klougart said. "They had not felt the sun for 13 days, and they missed the feeling of the sun on their skin." For Klougart, a memorable moment in "Reaching Europe" is the photo of the migrants as they sit with their eyes fixated on the miniscule laptop placed on a small chair in front of them. This photo -- No. 5 in the gallery above -- can be viewed as an image of an image, with subtle but important details. "I think it was the first time they saw a movie at the reception center in Pozzallo, and of course there is a big television just on top of the (laptop) screen, but it never worked," Klougart said. "And the ironic part is that it was such a violent movie that was shown. ... Even though (the migrants) didn't seem to care, I was thinking, 'What's going through their minds?' " Klougart hopes that "Reaching Europe" will enable people around the world to think about the lives of migrants and the contributions that can be made to better the lives of those men, women and children who must risk their lives in order to find a safe and stable refuge. She and Albers "hope that we, through our work, can maintain the public's interest in the (migrants) and force people and the European Union to take action," Klougart said. "Because we cannot wait for another boat to crash and to see more people die before we do so." Sofie Amalie Klougart is a photographer based in Copenhagen, Denmark.

        <titulo>Architects design 'world's tallest' wooden skyscraper - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-12T10:18:06Z</data>
        <autor>Eoghan Macguire, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)Forget steel and concrete. The new material of choice for skyscrapers could be wood if Canadian architect Michael Green has his way. Green's Vancouver-based MGA firm along with French architectural partners DVVD and real estate group REI France recently proposed what they claim would be the tallest wooden building in the world for Reinventer Paris, a design competition which sought new ideas for revitalizing architecture in the city. At 35-storeys tall, the tower at the center of the "Baobab" complex -- which also includes a student hotel, green space, bus station and e-car hub -- aims to help solve the French capital's housing challenges in a sustainable, creative and environmentally-friendly manner. Some within the project have even compared the concept to the Eiffel Tower in the iconic structures stakes. According to Green, the Eiffel Tower had a huge impact in inspiring architects to build with steel when it debuted as the world's tallest structure in 1889. Now he hopes Baobab can do the same. "Eiffel's vision redefined the skylines of the world, eventually (starting) the race for height in places like New York and Chicago in the 1920's and 30's and even... (in) new global cities in Asia and the Middle East today," Green told CNN via email. "We love the idea that a wood tower in Paris, however modest in some respects ... will help champion a new global wave of building with more sustainable, renewable and beautiful materials," he added.  The idea of a "plyscraper" may sound far fetched to those unfamiliar with the concept and there are currently no plans to construct the MGA building in Paris. But tall wooden buildings are an architectural development being given increasingly serious consideration in a number of locations around the world. Work is set to begin on the HoHo building, a 275-foot structure made almost entirely from wood in the Austrian capital of Vienna next year. Meanwhile, a 34-storey wooden apartment block could be built in Stockholm by 2023 if architecture firm C.F Moller has its way. MGA has already built the 97-foot tall Wood Innovation and Design Center in Prince George, Northern British Columbia. Other ambitious wood buildings have also sprung up in the likes of Australia and the United Kingdom too. The advantages of wood include its dexterity as a building material as well as its strong environmental credentials. Cross laminated timber -- a multiple panel wood product that is used to form the likes of walls, roof and floor panels -- in particular is has quickly established itself as a strong, reliable and popular wooden building material. "Wood, unlike steel and concrete, sequesters carbon dioxide, storing it away for the life of the building it is in," Green said. "As a renewable material grown by the power of the sun, wood offers us a new way to think about our future." Promotional literature relating to Baobab states it would store an estimated 3,700 metric tons of carbon dioxide. That's equivalent to keeping 2,207 cars off the road for a year or operating a home for 982 years, MGA state. The tower would also be constructed using a prefabricated construction method, where components are measured and built in a factory, often with space for doors, windows and wiring already carved into panels, before being rapidly transported and put together on site. This could potentially reduce cost, disruption and build time.  On the downside, however, critics say the drawbacks of large wooden structures include the potential for increased fire hazard and the fact that economies of scale are not quite there yet to make it massively cheaper than the likes of steel and concrete. Reports earlier this year suggested the Vienna fire department was liaising with the architectural firm behind the HoHo building to figure out how to minimize the blaze risk. Green confirms building such ambitious structures with timber would mean "reinventing wood; making it stronger, more fire safe, more durable and selecting material from sustainably managed forests." This last point is particularly relevant if wood is to fulfill its promise as a sustainable material. An efficient supply chain that replenished wood at a similar rate to which it was used would be a basic requirement. Then there are the difficulties of introducing new materials and designs into a model for building that's already relatively efficient and cost-effective. Leading timber specialist at the engineering group ARUP, Andrew Lawrence, told CNN earlier this year that shear walls -- the central core of tall buildings -- are likely to continue to be made from concrete and steel for the foreseeable future. Dollar-for-dollar as a pure construction material, he said, wood can still struggle to be cheaper than concrete. Green pointed out that all MGA wooden buildings so far have been built with "central elevator cores in mass timber." Although he added that the foundations have been made in concrete and steel has been used to make connections between the wood. However, Lawrence also pointed out that building with wood can still have its benefits if carefully planned out. "What you need to do if you want an economic wood solution is to think about all the aspects from outset," Lawrence says. "You will save on the program because it's all dry and is quick to erect and potentially, if you're making an office building, you can leave a lot of the wood exposed, saving on the cost and time of installing finishes." "If you leave the wood exposed, you can (also) have a really nice environment inside the building," he says. As Green and MGA suggest, there would better no location to put wood's aesthetic and structural fortitude to the test than the picturesque city of Paris. Read: The most ambitious luxury home ever?

        <titulo>How education shapes children's lives - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>The CNN Freedom Project wants to amplify the voices of the victims of modern-day slavery, highlight success stories and help unravel the tangle of criminal enterprises trading in human life. (CNN)What has education helped you achieve? That was the question the CNN Freedom Project posed to Twitter users in the run up to World Against Child Labor Day on June 12, which this year focuses on how education can help end the cycle of poverty and underage workers. The answers were as diverse as the respondents with your tweets showing just how much of an impact education has had on lives the world over. To highlight the importance of education, we asked you to share your old school photos. People from all walks of life got involved, telling the world how education helped them get to where they are now.  According to the International Labour Organization, 120 million children between the ages of five and 14 are involved in child labor, with some 98 million working in agriculture. For many of those children, going to school is impossible. Others have to fit their education around their work, making it harder to get skills they need to find decent jobs as adults. The result is that their own children in turn may need to work to support the family. Conversely, if children receive quality education up until legal employment age, they are much less likely to fall into poverty -- and if they are well employed as adults, they will not have to rely on their children to bring in additional income. That's why the CNN Freedom Project is highlighting the value of education. CNN anchors got involved with the initiative too, showing us how far they have come, thanks to a good education. "Education helped me to have lots of opportunities. My sports broadcast career began at university," said sports anchor and correspondent Alex Thomas. While CNN's Isa Soares said education helped her to "be insatiably curious, creative and critical."

        <titulo>Can Thai fishing industry tackle its slavery problem? - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-05-17T13:46:14Z</data>
        <autor>Dean Irvine, Saima Mohsin, and Kocha Olarn, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has told CNN that slave labor in his country's fishing industry "is now severe" and that Thailand will act to tackle it. CNN investigates the scale of the problem in this special report. (CNN)The hours would be long and the work hard, but spending a year as a fisherman seemed like a good option to Samart Senasook. Previous jobs as a security guard in Bangkok had been sporadic, so when a man known as Vee promised the 40-year old decent wages on a fishing boat he decided to take the chance. Vee turned out to be a broker, a link in the chain of human trafficking that supplies the Thai fishing industry with thousands of migrant workers and turns many of them into virtual slaves. Instead of a year on board a Thai fishing vessel, Senasook said he spent six, and was made to work 20-hour days in life-threatening conditions. His unwanted odyssey only came to an end last month, thousands of miles from Thailand, on the eastern Indonesian island of Ambon. The boat he was on was impounded by Indonesian authorities for suspected illegal fishing, with Senasook and his crewmates held in custody.  Looking back on his ordeal, that he says lasted from January 2009 to March 2015, Senasook rarely saw land, as the boat he was on roamed further and further from Thai waters in search of increasingly scarce fish. Its catch was part of Thailand's multi-billion dollar seafood industry that feeds tens of millions in Europe and the United States. Senasook describes his life on board as one full of intimidation, sleep deprivation and regular beatings from the boat's captain. "(The captain) kicked and punched me," he said. "My nose and mouth were bleeding. I still have blood clotted in my teeth. My jaw hurts every time I chew." With no way to escape, he became suicidal. "I was thinking of my family, my mother. There were times, I was about to jump into the sea to kill myself. "My friend from the engine room held me back. Otherwise I would have been dead by now," he said. Senasook says the boat's captain kept his and the crew's ID at all times, essentially holding them captive. When Senasook did finally get his hands on his identity card on Ambon, he was horrified to see it was in a false name. He had gone from being captive on board a fishing boat to being stranded on a distant island. "There are many of my friends die in Indonesia. And their graves were with wrong names," said Senasook. "Like, if I died, at my grave it would not bear my name but it would be someone else." In desperation, he wrote an open letter to the Thai Prime Minister asking for help. That helped to release him from Indonesian custody, but, isolated and penniless, he could not make his way home to Thailand. He received a final payment of 1,750 baht ($53) from his ship's captain, but was then told he needed to pay 20,000 baht ($615) for the agent fee that brought him on the boat in 2009.  Eventually he received assistance from Thai-based Labor Rights Promotion Network (LPN) and was repatriated to Thailand last month. He was one of the more fortunate ones. The LPN discovered a similar situation on the nearby island of Benjina, where the group says hundreds of other fishermen from across Southeast Asia were trapped and living in desperate conditions. The rights group estimates there could be up to 3,000 trafficked victims working on boats in these seas. "(The fishermen on Ambon and Benjina) have forged or no documents so can't return home," said the LPN's Patima Tangpratyakoon. "The situation is severe." But the problem of modern day slaves fishing for seafood that ends up on dinner plates on the other side of the world goes much further than these tiny Indonesian islands. The extent of the situation is hard to gauge. Thai government figures state that there are 145,000 working in its fishing industry, with 80% of those migrant workers, mainly from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. However, activist group Raks Thai Foundation suggests there are in excess of 200,000 trafficked, unregistered workers. The exact number of fishing vessels is also unknown -- official figures put them at around 57,000 -- because registration is lax. The real number could be double that.  The issue of slavery and rights abuses in the Thai fishing industry has become acute in recent years. As the global demand for seafood has increased, the Thai economy improved, so attracting workers to dangerous jobs on fishing boats has become more difficult. Last year the U.S. State Department downgraded Thailand to the lowest tier on its Trafficking in Persons Report 2014, which can result in the withdrawal of international aid. Last month the European Union called Thailand a "non-cooperating" country because of poor monitoring and control of its fishing vessels and the trade of fish and seafood from other countries into Thailand. Unless it cracks down on the situation, Thailand faces a financially damaging embargo on its fish exports to the EU from October. In response, Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has declared combating human trafficking a national priority. In a statement in March, he called on all government agencies to "clean up their houses." Traffickers and government officials that have colluded with them "no longer have any room to exist in Thai society," he said. According to Thailand's Department of Fisheries, new control measures are being implemented. As well as inspections of fishing vessels, boats more than 30 tons in size that travel outside of Thai waters will have to be equipped with an electronic vessel monitoring system (VMS). Without it, the boats will not be given a fishing license. However, only around 6,000 boats in the Thai fishing fleet are of this size, according to the Marine Department. Another new government initiative that came into play in April requires each fishing vessel to list who is on board, who it is licensed to, the name of its owner, and where it will operate before it leaves port and once it returns. These "port-out, port-in" measures "will help enable us to reduce the risk of human trafficking, reduce the risk of force labor," said Warapon Prompol, deputy director-general, Department of Fisheries. Crew manifests were not previously required. "For the Marine Department we can check only a certain type of vessel, a certain size, too. But now the government is trying to reduce the size (of the vessel) that allows that we can check them," said Chula Sukmanop, director-general to the Marine Department. He added that enforcement is made more difficult because all too often ships will change crew once they leave port.  While laws against human trafficking exist in the country -- a new Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act was approved as recently as March -- it has often been this lack of enforcement that has allowed exploitation of fishermen to continue. "There have been laws that should penalize employers with penalties and not just the migrants themselves, but they've been rarely enforced in the past," said Max Tunon, senior program manager for the International Labour Organization, who specializes in migrant workers' rights in Southeast Asia. "This is the most attention there's been on the issue, coming from the highest level," he added. "There's a greater acknowledgment that corruption exists and that increasing regulation (of the industry) needs to be linked to the broader issues of migration." Exports by Thai seafood companies to the United States and Europe are worth around $2.5 billion annually, with Thai Union Frozen Products (TUF) one of the largest -- and owner of the John West and Chicken of the Sea brands. In a statement in March, Khun Thiraphong Chansiri, TUF's president and CEO, called human trafficking in its supply chain "utterly unacceptable," but said "we all have to admit that it is difficult to ensure the Thai seafood industry's supply chain is 100% clean." Progress to combat the problems of trafficked workers and slave labor has been made thanks to market and trade pressure, said Tunon. But it's still hard to see real change on the ground. "It's been a challenge for years and it will be hard to measure progress because there has not been much of a baseline from which to gather credible information on the problem," said Tunon. "The attention is now on the fishing industry, as it's particularly vulnerable, but this could help better protection for migrant workers in sections that don't have consumer or trade pressure, that aren't so visible because they don't feed into the global supply chain." </corpo>

        <titulo>Slavery to doubt: An Eritrean migrant's story - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-05-15T16:18:10Z</data>
        <autor>Ben Wedeman, CNN International correspondent</autor>
        <corpo>Rome (CNN)"What are you doing here?" A man in a red t-shirt and a long black ponytail shouted angrily at us as we conducted interviews at a center for migrants -- most of whom were from Eritrea -- in the Rome suburb of Tiburtina. "You should be in Eritrea interviewing that demon there!" That "demon," the man went on to explain, is Isaias Afwerki, the country's president since 1993. The man told us he was from Eritrea and had been in Italy for eight years, but declined to be interviewed, fearing his relatives back home would be punished. Eritreans make up the second largest group of migrants, after Syrians, reaching the shores of Europe.  But unlike the Syrians, the Eritreans aren't fleeing war. Instead they are refugees from what human rights activists describe as a system of official slavery&#8212;open-ended military service for all males and unmarried females between the ages of 18 and 50. Benjamin, 23, comes from Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. When we met him in a park in Ponte Mammolo in northern Rome, he had been in Italy for about eight days. "I ran away from Eritrea because I don't want to serve in the military," he told me. "I was hiding from place-to-place for a very long time. My family suffered too much trying to hide me. I had to move out. My destiny was to be in the military and that's not what I want. The only opportunity I have is running away." Benjamin spoke almost flawless English, which he taught himself while on the run. When we interviewed him, he asked that we not show his face. He was one of the few in the park who were willing to be interviewed at all. The day before Italian police had come in the morning with bulldozers and demolished a small shanty town of plywood and corrugated iron shacks that had housed around 200 migrants. Benjamin's "house" as he calls it, is a strip of cardboard he sleeps on under a tree. His story is similar to many we've heard from other migrants.  His family scraped together as much money as they could to pay what he described as "facilitators" to help him escape from Eritrea and travel across Ethiopia and Sudan to Libya, where he ended up in the town of Ajdabia. In Ajdabia, a town I spent lots of time in during the Libyan uprising in 2011, he stayed for a month in a house run by several facilitators, ironically, fellow Eritreans. The bonds of nationality didn't count for much. "He was a very terrible person," recalled Benjamin. "The only thing he wanted from us was money. He didn't feed us properly. To be honest I didn't take a shower for the full month I was in that house. You were allowed to go to the bathroom only one time a day." The facilitators "took our phones, they took everything we had in our pockets. I had &#8364;200. They took my wallet and my documents. All I had was the clothing I was wearing." Summing up the experience in Ajdabia, he said "it was the example of hell." From Ajdabia he and other Eritrean migrants were moved to the Libyan capital, Tripoli. There they were crammed with around 600 others onto a two-level fishing boat. "The engine burned out two or three times and the fan belt also broke. We stayed in the middle of nowhere for seven hours," he told me. "Everybody gave up on that boat," he said. "We were just praying to God to help us. Some people were fighting there. Some people were sitting inside the engine room. Many were unconscious. It was too hot, and people were vomiting." Benjamin was in a cramped, suffocating room on the lower deck. "I was vomiting from the time I got onto the boat. It was so crowded, but I sat on top of my friend and had my face in a little window where I could breathe. I don't remember what happened after that. I was just feeling my pain." After around 13 hours at sea, he heard a helicopter overhead. Someone shut off the engine, and they waited until rubber dinghies from the Italian Navy came to their rescue.  The Navy took them first to a receiving center on the island of Lampedusa, and then they were moved to another center in Sicily. "After we reach Sicily, they start forcing the people to be fingerprinted so we decided to run away," he said. According to European Union regulations, migrants must be registered in the country they arrive in, and cannot go on to request asylum elsewhere. To avoid being registered, he and his friends left the center, saying they were going to a nearby church. "And once we went outside we never went back," he said. With help from friends, who gave him &#8364;50, he said he was able to get to Rome, with &#8364;7 left over. In Ponte Mammalo, local churches provided him and other migrants with food and clothing. Benjamin's goal is eventually get to Germany, where he hopes to get an education and a "better life." He has no relatives there, speaks no German, but clings to the vague hope that somehow he will land on his feet. "It's just me," he says with a smile. </corpo>

        <titulo>Chinese feminists show off armpit hair in photo contest - CNN.com</titulo>

        <autor>Wilfred Chan and Shen Lu, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Beijing (CNN)In the fight against domestic violence and gender inequality, Chinese feminists have opened up a new battlefront: Their armpits. They ask, why should women have to shave their pits when men are never expected to? To subvert the double standard, feminist Xiao Meili, 25, started an armpit hair photo contest on Chinese social network Weibo. Dozens of women have participated, including three of the five feminists briefly arrested in March over a protest for gender equality. The participants sent in selfies and glamor shots with their arms proudly raised, revealing natural hair underneath. "Women should have the right to decide how to deal with their bodies, including small details like armpit hair," Xiao tells CNN. "You can choose to shave it, but you shouldn't be forced to do so under the pressure of stereotypes." Six winners will be selected from the photo competition, which ends Wednesday. Prizes include condoms, vibrators and a pedestal urinal that a woman can use while standing.  Xiao, who became a feminist in college after reading female authors like Simone de Beauvoir, says the aesthetics of silky smooth armpits didn't become popular in China until around 20 years ago, as American influences swept into the country. Before that, nobody thought showing armpit hair was an issue. As a small child, Xiao recalled her mother's indifference over armpit hair. "She said, 'I don't have much of it. Plus it will eventually shed years later. Why would I bother removing it?'" These days, shaving has become the norm for China women -- but it's not right, says Xiao. "The media coverage on female celebrities' underarms is disgusting, as if women shouldn't have hair or it's something to be ashamed of, while male celebrities openly show off their armpit hair." As one participant says beneath her photo submission: "I love my armpit hair. It's part of my body. I hope girls can show off their armpit hair without fear."  To Xiao, concern over the armpit hair issue isn't trivial -- it's a matter of principle. "Some people question why I make a fuss about the hair. They say there are more important issues that need to be solved like domestic violence and sexual assault. I think they are equally important. They're all about fighting for gender equality." Xiao has tackled other issues concerning women. Last year, she walked more than 1,200 miles across China, sending letters to officials in each city she visited to raise awareness of sex abuse in Chinese schools. Before that, she has staged public art performances to protest everything from violence against women to unfair ratios of male-to-female public restrooms. But it hasn't been easy. In March, five of her friends, fellow activists, were detained after planning a protest in Beijing to counter sexual harassment on public transportation. They were only released a month later after news had spread around the world, leading even Hillary Clinton to condemn the arrests.  Although China's current regime was founded on values of gender equality -- Mao Zedong banned old practices such as the binding of women's feet, and famously declared "In China, women hold up half the sky," -- women in today's China face violence and discrimination. According to a 2013 U.N. report, over half of men surveyed in China said they had committed an act of violence against a woman, and over one-fifth confessed to raping a woman. At the same time, women face extreme pressure to marry early, or else risk becoming a "leftover woman." Women who remain single, or fall outside beauty standards, are mocked as "manly women" -- sometimes on national television. And women remain underrepresented in leadership fields: No woman has ever reached China's Standing Committee, the country's highest-ranking political body. No matter: Xiao says she is determined to see the fight through. "Gender discrimination exists wherever there are people," she says. "Something needs to be done. We want our voices heard." </corpo>

        <titulo>Tamir Rice report: No proof officer warned before shots - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-14T15:46:04Z</data>
        <autor>Ralph Ellis and Melissa Gray, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)The Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department on Saturday released an investigation report in the Cleveland police shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. While offering no opinion whether two officers should be prosecuted, the report reveals new detail about the shooting. A city police officer shot and killed Rice on November 22. A citizen had called the 911 center to report a "guy with a pistol" outside a city recreation center, but the responding officers weren't told the caller said the gun might be "fake" and the guy might be a juvenile. Rice actually had a pellet gun. Will the officer and his partner be charged? On Thursday a judge said he thought there was probable cause, but his opinion is not binding. A grand jury will study this investigation report and decide whether to indict. Here are some of the report's major takeaways:  The police department has said Officer Timothy Loehmann "shouted verbal commands" from inside his patrol car before firing at Rice, but the report says witness interviews don't back up that statement. Loehmann and his partner, Frank Garmback, didn't talk to the sheriff's office investigators. The patrol car didn't have a dashboard camera and security video cameras at the recreation center don't have audio. One woman who lives nearby said she heard two popping sounds, then shouting, then a third popping sound. Loehmann only fired two shots, however.  An FBI agent happened to be in the area following up a bank robbery, heard about the incident and arrived about three minutes after the shooting. He found Rice lying on the ground. The two officers appeared upset and shell-shocked, he said, wanting to help Rice but not knowing what to do. The agent, a national registered paramedic who'd served in the military, tried to stop the bleeding and got assistance from an officer when he asked for it. Janell Rutherford, supervisor for patrols in that area, said patrol cars were not equipped with first-aid kits and officers had no first-aid training beyond basic CPR.  The initial call to 911 described a male with a gun at the recreation center, who might have been a juvenile. Officers at the scene said they thought Rice was 16-20 and the FBI agent said he first thought Rice was "eighteen-ish," based on his size. Rice was 5 feet 7 and weighed 195 pounds, according to the autopsy. The agent said he heard Rice's sister screaming that he was only 12 years old. The agent said, "I remember thinking to myself, I'm like, 'There's no way.' And I looked at his face, I'm like, 'Yeah.' He's got a young-looking face. ..."  Rice traded a cell phone to a friend for the pistol. The friend told investigators he'd taken the air pistol apart and couldn't refasten the orange tip that distinguishes air pistols from real ones. The gun is listed as a "replica firearm," a Colt 1911 target pistol that's 11.25 inches long. One officer said it looked "a thousand percent real."  "I asked him his name which he replied to me -- told me, and then he said that he was shot and he made a reference to his, uh, regarding like a gun or a question like, 'Where's my gun?' ... I can't remember exactly what it was. I just remembered that he made reference to a firearm."  Though he didn't talk to Cuyahoga County investigators, Loehmann talked briefly to the FBI agent while he sat in a patrol car nursing an ankle injured during the shooting at the rec center. Loehmann said, "He [Rice] had a gun and he reached for it," according to the agent.  Loehmann fired from a distance of 4.5 to 7 feet from Rice. The patrol car rolled onto the grass at the Cudell Recreation Center and Loehmann exited the vehicle and fired twice within two seconds. Cleveland police were investigating the shooting, but amid calls for an independent investigation, the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department was brought in. Many of the interviews with witnesses were conducted in March, more than three months after Rice was killed. </corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Raif Badawi set up a website to express his views and those of others. For that he was sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes with a whipping cane. To Saudi Arabian authorities, the blogger is a criminal. And for that, he is to be publicly flogged -- as happened in January, when he stoically arched his back in pain while getting 50 lashes. He's supposed to get 19 more rounds of such punishment, according to the advocacy group Human Rights Watch. The second batch of 50 lashes was supposed to come not long after the first, but it's been pushed back several times -- including Friday. Amnesty reported as much on Twitter, as did Badawi's wife Ensaf Haidar. "No flogging for today," Haidar wrote on her husband's Twitter account. "I repeat my appeal to his majesty King Salman to pardon my husband #RaifBadawi and stop his flogging."  Badawi has been behind bars since 2012 for his online posts and running a blog called "Saudi Arabian Liberals," where he hosted political and religious debate and advocated secularism in a highly religious society. In 2013, a court originally sentenced him to seven years and 600 lashes, but the punishment was upped upon appeal, Human Rights Watch has said. The sharper measures also includes a fine of about $265,000, the group said. The sentencing covers convictions for violating the kingdom's information technology law, insulting Islam, and according to HRW, "blasphemous phrases on his Facebook page and disobedience to his father." On Monday, Saudi Arabia's Supreme Court upheld the sentence, now Badawi has no more appeals.  The lashings were supposed to happen about once a week for 20 weeks, in a place open to public viewing. A light wooden cane is used for the lashes, which are administered on the legs and back, HRW said. They usually leave bruises but don't often break the skin. But eight days after the initial flogging, doctors determined that Badawi's injuries had not healed sufficiently to be flogged for the second time, Amnesty International reported. Another round would be detrimental, they said. The second beating has been postponed many times, including on Friday. "His health is poor, and he cannot take another round of lashes," Badawi's wife, Haidar, told Amnesty then.  On top of health concerns, the first lashing ignited international outcry from human rights activists and from Western governments. Before the supreme court decision, U.S. officials had called on Saudi officials to withdraw the sentence and review Badawi's case. Human Rights Watch said in protest at the time, "Publicly lashing a peaceful activist merely for expressing his ideas sends an ugly message of intolerance."

        <titulo>Fame poses new risk for China's 'magic rabbit' - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Rarer than a panda, few people knew about the Ili pika until earlier this year when pictures of China's "magic bunny" went viral after being featured in a series of news reports. But now the tiny and endangered mammal is finding out the price of fame. Conservationist Li Weidong, who discovered the species in 1983, lamented the lack of funding for his conservation efforts when first interviewed by CNN in March. READ: Meet China's 'magic rabbit' He's since been able to raise almost $28,000 on a Chinese crowd-funding website, enough to fund his research and conservation efforts for the next year. But Li told CNN this week that the tiny mammal now faces other threats. People have tried to catch the pika, wanting one as a pet. Companies have offered Li funding to catch the pika and then artificially breed them, Li said. "Ili pikas, as alpine animals, can't adapt to the environment at low elevations without special facilities," he said. "Would they survive? Their population is already small enough. Human capture will accelerate the extinction." Fearing that cameras might disturb pikas, Li said he has also turned away a dozen more photographers who hoped accompany him on his field research in the Tianshan mountains.  Native to the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, there are fewer than 1,000 of these creatures living in the Tianshan mountain range in the region, Li said. Li discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, and named it after his hometown, Ili. A year ago, Li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery. In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Li. For years, Li has called for Ili Pika to be listed on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law. The appeal seems more urgent now as more people have laid eyes on the it, Li said. Li said he is in negotiation with authorities in Jinghe County, where many Ili Pikas were discovered, for the establishment of a nature reserve to keep people away from the rare animals.  In late May, Li led a team of five volunteers to collect video footage from infrared cameras set up last August. Some 30 infrared cameras captured about 16 video clips of the Pika from the two areas over the past 10 months. Li said the video clips showed that pikas communicate with each other through their own urine traces and bodily waste. "They can tell by sniffing whether another pika is nearby. If it is a member of the opposite sex, they find a mate. If it is within its own gender, they claim territory." However, Li didn't find any pikas in the two sites where he spotted and photographed the elusive creature in July last year. He said this doesn't mean there are fewer pikas now as footage from one more area is yet to be collected and the cameras only covered half of the census areas. Yet it still worries him, he said. "We don't know whether it's because the animals didn't come out during the winter, or they were eaten by natural enemies or they died." To collect more accurate and complete information, Li said he plans to buy more infrared cameras with the recently raised money and set them up in all six areas. </corpo>

        <titulo>Iraqi who has seen it all: ISIS in Mosul to stay - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Baghdad (CNN)We had just finished up our shoot in Al-Makasib Girls' Elementary School in Baghdad's Saadoun neighbourhood and were loading the gear into the car when a man sitting in a wheelchair across the courtyard beckoned to me. "Come, talk to me, too," he said. He introduced himself as Louay Hikmat Shawkat, Iraqi Army veteran of the war with Iran and then the 1991 Kuwait war, refugee from Mosul and a self-described translator of English, French, "Canadian" and "Yugoslavian." Given that the latter two aren't languages, and his English was a tad scratchy, I was intrigued. We were visiting the school to talk to its current "residents" -- 48 Christian families who had fled Mosul when ISIS took over a year ago. Mosul, in northern Iraq and one of the nation's largest cities, is about 405 kilometers (about 250 miles) from the capital of Baghdad. But for these internal refugees, it might as well be a world away. I asked Louay, who is 60, when he thought he might be able to return home.  "Take it out of your mind that ISIS is going to leave Mosul," he insisted, gesturing with his hand as if he were pulling a thread out of his head. The chances he and his wife will someday return to their home in the Mosul suburb of Hamdaniya, he said, are "one in a hundred. One in a million!" Louay said he suffers from diabetes, but he insists on lighting up another cigarette in his nicotine-stained fingers "because I get upset whenever I speak about "Da'ish", the Arabic acronym for ISIS. ISIS, he said, "is an illness. It's impossible to cure. Cancer can be cured, tuberculosis can be cured. Almost every illness can be cured, but not this one." His diabetes causes him to suffer from dizziness whenever he stands up. "If I were well," he vows, "I would go fight them myself." Like everyone else I spoke with at the school, he is desperate to leave Iraq, but his attempts to apply for asylum have come to naught. His last hope, he told me with a mischievous grin, is an old Canadian girlfriend in Montreal.  In the school's makeshift kitchen, I met Linda Jannan, who was busy with the washing up. She fled Mosul with her husband and three children in August, first going to Dohuk, in Iraqi Kurdistan, where they spent six months in a tent in a refugee camp. A thin women in her 30s with the dark circles under her eyes, she also was desperate to leave Iraq. "We are finished," she told me. "Our future, our children, our men have been destroyed. We're too afraid to go out and find work. If only someone outside Iraq will help us find a solution, let us emigrate. We have no hope left." She and her husband had applied to asylum in the United States and Germany, but they were rejected because they have no close relatives in either country. Obama: No 'complete strategy' yet on training Iraqis Over the past few months, these refugees have been visited by a variety of reporters. And it's clear their patience is wearing thin. "What's the point of all this talk?" one man asked me, after declining my request for an on-camera interview. "We talk, we talk, and nothing happens," he snapped. Firyal Abdel Kareem, who was sharing the kitchen with Linda Jannan, is at her wits' end. She spent the winter months in a windy tent in Zakho, near the Turkish border, and is now suffering from Baghdad's sweltering summer heat. "Find a solution for us," she told me, "it's enough. We are tired." "Either they take us out of here, or send us home. Do we have to stay in this school, or in a tent?"  I've been covering Iraq since 1994. I covered the impact of the draconian international sanctions imposed on the country after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. I covered the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and the messy, bloody aftermath. And now I'm back covering the war against ISIS. I'm lucky. I come and go as I please. For the people in this school, there is no such luxury. Thair Al-Naim, his wife and their three young sons left behind a relatively comfortable life in Mosul last summer. He's now penniless and out of work, all his construction equipment seized and sold by ISIS. Speaking to him in the classroom they now call "home," I sense a deep weariness with a life that, for too long, has been fraught with violence and fear. "Since the fall of Saddam," he sighs, "all we've had is war after war, and now we have Da'ish." CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>Chinese astronaut: We want more cooperation - CNN.com</titulo>

        <autor>David McKenzie, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>"Inside Space City," a world exclusive CNN interview with three of China's top astronauts, premieres on Friday May 29 at 11:30 pm ET Beijing (CNN)China wants greater cooperation with other nations in space, particularly the United States, the country's most experienced astronaut has told CNN in an exclusive interview. Fifteen nations including the United States, Russia and Japan cooperate on International Space Station missions, but China's involvement has always been a non-starter because of longstanding resistance from U.S. legislators. INTERACTIVE: IS CHINA WINNING THE SPACE RACE? "As an astronaut, I have a strong desire to fly with astronauts from other countries. I also look forward to going to the International Space Station," Commander Nie Haisheng told CNN. "...Space is a family affair, many countries are developing their space programs and China, as a big country, should make our own contributions in this field." The comments came during a wide-ranging and exclusive interview with the three-person crew of the Shenzhou-10 mission inside Space City, the center of China's space program, near Beijing last month. In 2011, Congress passed an act to bar NASA from having any bilateral contact with individuals of the Chinese space program because of national security fears. "Every time it gets mentioned at all anywhere near Congress, it gets shut down immediately," space analyst Miles O'Brien told CNN. "There is tremendous skepticism there about China. It is viewed as a foe, it is viewed as a government that seeks to take our intellectual property -- our national secrets and treasure." In a white paper released Tuesday, China said that outer space had become an area of "strategic competition." "The Chinese government has always advocated the peaceful use of outer space, it opposes space weaponization and an arms race in outer space. This position will not be changed," Wang Jin, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, said. MORE: NASA astronaut: We risk losing out to China  A recent report for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said China's improving space capabilities had "negative sum consequences for U.S. military security." But Nie discounted those fears. "The United States and Russia started their space programs early. They are the pioneers," he said. He says foreign astronauts are welcome to visit China's own space station once it is launched. The Chinese expect to finish their space station by 2022 -- around the time International Space Station runs out of funding, potentially leaving China as the only country with a permanent presence in space. China launched its manned space program in 1992. It initially borrowed and bought a great deal of Russian technology, primarily by replicating their Soyuz space craft -- which they dubbed the Shenzhou. But it has been steadily checking off the boxes in manned space flight. In 2003, it put its first man in space. In 2008, it completed its first space walk. And in 2013 Nie and his crew completed the country's longest space mission to date and twice docked with the Tiangong-1 space lab. MORE: Meet the crew of the Shenzhou-10  With support from the highest echelons of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and exceptionally deep pockets, most analysts believe China's space program could become a world leader. "I think in the end -- tortoise versus hare style, they will probably win," said O'Brien. In October last year, China launched its most ambitious unmanned space mission to date: to orbit the moon and then return to Earth. Nicknamed "Xiaofei," or "Little Flyer" on Chinese social networks, the unmanned orbiter traversed 840,000 kilometers on its eight-day mission that saw it round the far side of the moon and take some incredible pictures of Earth and the moon together, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. It then successfully re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and parachuted down to the surface in Inner Mongolia. Wu Yanhua, vice director of China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, said at the time the successful test mission has gathered a lot of experimental data and laid "a solid foundation for future missions." While China hasn't committed to it, many analysts think it wants to put a man on the moon. However, when asked, Commander Nie won't be drawn on whether this is the ultimate goal of the country's space program. "For the next step, the focus is Tiangong-2 and then we will do more preparatory work for the space station." </corpo>

        <titulo>YSL ad with 'unhealthily' thin model banned in UK - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>London (CNN)The UK's advertising watchdog has banned an ad for fashion brand Yves Saint Laurent featuring a model who it said was "unhealthily underweight." The Advertising Standards Authority ruled the black-and-white image of a model in a short, black dress and platform high heels was "irresponsible." The ad appeared in Elle UK magazine. The model's pose and the lighting effect drew attention to her rib cage, which was "visible and appeared prominent," the ruling found. The ad also focused on her legs, adding that "her thighs and knees appeared a similar width, and ... looked very thin," especially the "contrast between the narrowness of her legs and her platform shoes," according to the ruling. The ad is the latest in a long line of controversies surrounding the fashion industry's use of thin models, among them the death from anorexia of French model Isabelle Caro following a shocking ad campaign and bans on ultra-skinny models in Israel and France. The UK agency looked into the ad following a complaint from an Elle UK reader. In response to the ruling, Yves Saint Laurent SAS indicated it didn't agree with the view that the model was unhealthily thin "but did not provide a detailed response," the agency said. Both Elle UK magazine and Yves Saint Laurent declined to comment on the ban when CNN reached out to them. A representative from Beat, a UK charity that supports those affected by eating disorders said: "The constant portrayal of a very slender look as the only aspirational ideal for young people needs to be challenged if a generation (is) to grow up with a robust sense of their self-worth." "The ASA ruling is not about whether this person in the picture is healthy, but whether the images of her are being used in a way that can have an irresponsible effect on others, and we are really pleased to see that they are taking action to uphold their responsibility for the social impact of adverts," the rep added. The Advertising Standards Authority said that the ad must not appear again in its current form and called on advertisers to ensure images in their ads were created responsibly. </corpo>

        <titulo>Architect designs giant 3D-printed estate - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-03T11:47:58Z</data>

        <corpo>(CNN)There's already a 3D-printed house being built in the Netherlands. In China, 3D-printed mansions are reportedly on the rise. Now, a 3D printed estate featuring a swimming pool, jacuzzi, car port and 2,400 square foot house could be coming to a sleepy plot of land in upstate New York. The ambitious project is being undertaken by New York City architect Adam Kushner, alongside partners including 3D-printing pioneer Enrico Dini and his D-Shape firm. Kushner told CNN that surveying has already begun with excavation work also set to commence soon. The swimming pool and jacuzzi are penciled in to be completed by December 2015 while construction of the house is expected to continue until the end of 2017, he says. But the project hinges on getting the giant 3D printer, which will be used to produce the digitally designed building blocks of the estate on-site, into the country. The device is currently in Italy after it was originally being built for a project partly funded by the Italian defense agencies. Military clearance is now required before the green light is given to export the printer to the United States, Dini says. The delay in receiving this clearance is part of the reason the project has been held up since it was first announced back in August 2014. "We are now waiting (for) permission to borrow the printer (from the military)," Dini says. "If I had another printer I'd send it there tomorrow, but unfortunately we don't have and must wait."  Whatever the import-export issues, Kushner says he sees the estate project as a test of D-Shape's printer technology and its distinctive method. This practice entails collecting sand, dust and gravel on site and mixing them with a magnesium-based binding agent to produce the 3D-printed building blocks required to piece the estate together. According to literature on the D-Shape website, the material produced by the printer is "similar to marble" in its constitution. This technique is vastly different from other 3D-printing methods, Kushner says, and enables the production of many more "sculptural forms" that simply aren't possible with other systems. If D-Shape can prove its technology works and is efficient for a project of this size, Kushner believes it could lead to all manner of possibilities in architecture and construction. Not only could it be faster and safer than existing construction methods, he says, it could also end up being cheaper, more streamlined and of higher quality. And although the 3D-printed estate is something only the very wealthiest would be able to replicate, Kushner sees D-Shape's construction methods benefiting the less fortunate as well. "This will serve as a way of using our project to ... pave the way for more humanitarian purposes that we see as the highest and best use for our technology," he says. "If we can build a simple pool house, I can print thousands of refugee housings. If I can build a pool, I can print underwater reefs (which he says D-Shape has already done before) to repair bridges, piers and infrastructures."  Integrating progressively more advanced 3D-printing methods into the construction industry has been a topic that has generated many eye-catching headlines in recent years. The process of contour crafting -- where large 3D printers are assembled on a building site (much like what will happen on Kushner's estate) and programmed to construct pre-designed concrete structures and their relevant sub-components -- was put forward by Dr. Behrokh Khoshnevis of the University of Southern California as far back as 2009. Khoshnevis told industry website 3DPrint.com earlier this year that the first printers large enough for his version of contour crafting should become available within the next two years. He added that the method could even be used to build high-rise structures within ten years. Chinese firm WinSun seemed to take inspiration from Khoshnevis' methods when they claimed to have 3D printed a mansion and six-story tower block in the city of Suzhou, eastern China earlier this year. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, DUS Architects continue to piece together a 3D-printed house using its "KamerMaker" machine. Company co-founder Katherine De Wit described the DUS technique as being a potentially valuable tool that could be added to those already used to build homes. Other experts, however are more cautious about the immediate potential of 3D-printing technology in the construction industry. In an interview with CNN in 2014, Dr. Phil Reeves, managing director of UK-based 3D-printing consultancy and research firm Econolyst, described 3D-printing a house on site like that planned by DUS as counter to existing building techniques which are already relatively efficient. Then there are other fast-developing building methods like prefabricated construction which entails manufacturing components in a factory before transporting and rapidly piecing them together on a building site. Chinese firm Broad Sustainable Building claimed to have used this method to piece together a 57-story skyscraper in just 19 days earlier this year. For Kushner, however, the benefits of large-scale 3D-printing are many and will likely increase as the technology becomes more advanced. "This is not superfluous, nor a lazy architects idyll," he says. "I think it's as important as the automobile was in changing the design of cities or how the printing press altered communication." "Why? Because it democratizes construction and architecture and puts it into everyone's hands, just like the camera phone made everyone a photographer. Not everyone is good at it but everyone can become one." Read: Dutch firm build 'world's first 3D-printed house Read: Life inside the densest place on earth </corpo>

        <titulo>Amanpour joins migrant rescue operation - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-05-22T16:47:11Z</data>
        <autor>Christiane Amanpour and Dominique van Heerden, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Lampedusa, Italy (CNN)The Italian Navy approached the rickety wooden ship with caution, and a wide berth. Go in too quickly, and the people onboard become so excited about their impending rescue that they capsize by all moving to one side. This is how so many of the drowning disasters have happened. As European leaders decide on measures to tackle the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean, the race to save lives on the high seas goes on, as our CNN team witnessed firsthand. We started our day on a helicopter bound for the frigate Virginio Fasan, one of the Italian Navy's most modern warships, currently in international waters facing the Libyan coast. Along with four other Italian naval vessels they patrol an area of sea about the size of the United Kingdom; some 80,000 square miles. It's a huge effort for the 1,000 men and women continuously at sea, because each rescue takes several hours. Barely 30 minutes into our chopper flight journey the pilot tells us they have spotted a boat, possibly full of migrants. And onboard screens beaming imagery of a wooden vessel packed to the gills confirms their suspicions. The blue boat is on course for Lampedusa, they've completed almost half the journey from Libya 85 miles from where we are... now in international waters the smugglers use their cell phones to call the Italian coast guard for help! That's their MO. The warship Sfinge (Sphinx) is closest, and is promptly dispatched to rescue those onboard. Crew on smaller boats hand out the distinctive orange life vests as soon as they arrive. To get closer and at sea level&#8212;we fly back to the Fasan and get into the ship's speed boat, and watch as navy teams move people to the warship in small groups. All personnel involved in the operation are dressed head to toe in white biohazard suits, face masks and gloves, in case of infectious disease. We're told that in all the crossings not a single case of Ebola has been brought over. The boat has been checked for hostile intent, and once the navy is satisfied they are all migrants, they begin the slow process of off-loading these people and transferring them by their two small boats to the warship. One by one they bring each person up the stairs&#8212;give them a medical, hand out bottles of water, and sit them in rows on the top deck, under the broiling sun. Men are separated from the women and children. One person died, suffocated during the overcrowded boat ride from Libya. Three people had to be medevaced off&#8212;but in all this mission saved 289 lives. They are among 900 who were saved on Wednesday in three different wooden boats, because it was sunny and calm. Most of the migrants saved on this day are from Ethiopia, Sudan, and Eritrea in East Africa, escaping a dictatorial regime and military service that they say amounts to slavery. Almost nobody on board speaks English, but one man tells us his story, saying he left his wife and children over a year ago, and hopes his arrival in Europe will mean he can afford a better life for them back home. And even though he knows a lot of people have died trying to make this dangerous crossing, he tells he was not afraid. "We have one chance, to live or to die," he says. We also talk to 25-year-old Juri, who tells us that God answered their prayers in the form of the Italian Navy. "God is good," she says with a big smile on her face, "they save our lives." UPDATE: On Friday, UNHCR reported that 180 of those rescued had been transferred to four facilities in eastern Sicily. The rest, they say, are still at the port and will be transferred soon. The one fatality was a 17-year-old Eritrean man, who reportedly died of asphyxiation in the hull of the boat. CNN's Mick Krever contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Iraq roils in a maelstrom: ISIS now controls Ramadi, a new prime minister is in charge, Shiite-Sunni bloodshed flows, and a U.S.-led coalition is back, this time executing airstrikes in Iraq. The saga of Iraq is, as an analyst put it, "a rather straightforward but sad story" since the U.S. military left the country at the end of 2011, only to find itself returning in a smaller way. The fall of Ramadi to ISIS this week strikes many as a milestone because the city is the capital of Iraq's biggest province and because U.S. troops heroically fought insurgents there in the mid-2000s. Some politicians feel the U.S. withdrawal of troops was a mistake, though public opinion favored it then. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Too late for that now," said Paul Salem of the nonpartisan Middle East Institute. See Interactive Timeline on ISIS's Rise Iraq's problems are bigger than Ramadi: its second largest city, Mosul, is now ISIS' capital, and Iraq still struggles with self-governance, politically and militarily. Here are events since late 2011 that help explain Iraq's ongoing conflict:  December 31, 2011 After almost 4,500 Americans were killed and more than 30,000 injured since 2003 when the United States invaded Iraq, President Barack Obama orders the withdrawal of all troops. The President welcomes them home. "The war in Iraq will soon belong to history," Obama says. "Your service belongs to the ages. "We are leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people," the President also says. The return of U.S. soldiers fulfills Obama's campaign pledge in 2008 to end the war. In Iraq, the day is celebrated as "Iraq Day."  February 2012 Tension grows between Iraq's Shiite and Sunni sects. Their blood feud reaches back decades. The Shiites control the central government under Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi is accused of terrorism by the top judicial committee. The body alleges al-Hashimi's security detail carried out 150 attacks between 2005 and 2011. Al-Hashimi dismisses the accusations as politics, noting the judicial committee is controlled by Shiites, and his party threatens to boycott parliament.  March 2012 Some good news, relatively speaking. Violence kills 112 people, the lowest monthly death toll since the U.S-led invasion in 2003, officials say. It's a good sign for the country's ability to maintain security. Iraq also hosts an Arab League summit, a gathering that signals the political emergence of postwar democratic Iraq. But it doesn't last long: By July, violence reaches a nearly two-year peak, with 325 deaths that month.  June 2012 Prime Minister al-Maliki comes under increasing criticism but he survives the threat of a no-confidence vote by parliament. President Jalal Talabani announces that there is not enough support for the vote. Al-Maliki's opponents accuse him of monopolizing power. Later, Osama al-Nujaifi, speaker of parliament, presses efforts to oust al-Maliki and says the Prime Minister will be asked to appear before the governing body.  September 10, 2012 Al-Hashimi, Iraq's top Sunni politician, is given a death sentence in absentia, and he lashes out at the country's top Shiite leader, Prime Minister al-Maliki. Al-Hashimi denies overseeing death squads. "The verdict is unjust, political and illegitimate and I will not acknowledge it," al-Hashimi tells reporters in Ankara, Turkey, where he has been living since fleeing Iraq five months earlier. "To my dear people, I say, make sure that al-Maliki and those who stand behind him don't get what he wishes. Because they want sectarian strife," al-Hashimi says. He remains in exile.  December 31, 2012 The anniversary of the U.S. troops' departure is celebrated as "Day of Sovereignty." But the political climate remains divisive. Days before the anniversary, thousands of Sunnis protest in the streets of Anbar province, a region key to trade with Jordan and Syria, and the Sunnis denounced al-Maliki's order to arrest the bodyguards of Finance Minister Rafaie Esawi, a Sunni. Sunnis and ethnic Kurds accuse al-Maliki and his Shiite political party of cutting them out of the political process, an allegation that comes as U.S. lawmakers raise concerns about Iraq strengthening its ties with Shiite-dominated Iran.  March 2013 Syria, torn by civil war, increasingly loses control of its border with Iraq. Concern looms that Sunni militants on both sides of the border will be capable of challenging governments in both Damascus and Baghdad and control a no-man's land. This foreshadows the rise of ISIS, which began as a splinter group of al Qaeda. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria dreams of creating an Islamic state, or caliphate, across the Sunni areas of Iraq and in Syria. The month also marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S.-led coalition invading Iraq and later ousting authoritarian leader Saddam Hussein.  July 2013 Iraq sees the deadliest month in the last five years since sectarian violence peaked in 2006 and 2007: 1,057 Iraqis are killed and 2,326 more are wounded in acts of terrorism and violence. Al Qaeda in Iraq was declared "on the run" before the U.S. pullout, but now it and other Sunni extremist groups grow stronger as the Shiite-led government fails to bring Sunnis into the political fold. Iraq's Sunni population claims that it is targeted by government forces and grows more alienated and disenfranchised. Al Qaeda in Iraq has expanded into Syria under the umbrella of "Al Qaeda in Iraq and the Levant (Syria)."  January 2014 Questions arise on whether Prime Minister al-Maliki can hold Iraq together against a rising insurgency. ISIS grows. It was known as al Qaeda in Iraq, but now the acronym "ISIS" appears more in news accounts as the militant group seeks to create a single Islamic state in Syria, Iraq and even Lebanon. ISIS continues to exploit a security vacuum across Iraq. It and government troops battle in Ramadi and Falluja -- famous battlegrounds from the days when U.S. forces occupied the country. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says the United States will help the Iraqi government in the battle against al Qaeda-linked fighters in western Iraq, but he stresses that America won't send troops. ISIS fighters are "the most dangerous players in the region," Kerry says.  February 2014 Al Qaeda and ISIS divorce, so to speak. Al Qaeda's central leadership says ISIS "is not a branch of the al Qaeda group." ISIS rejects al Qaeda's leadership. Al Qaeda describes ISIS as too brutal. One thing is clear: the jihadists are infighting.  June 2014 ISIS seizes Mosul in northern Iraq and threatens a march on Baghdad. Another northern city, Samarra, is besieged. A strategic border crossing in the western province of Anbar, the largest geographically in Iraq, falls to ISIS fighters. They also take four small towns. The speed of Iraq's deterioration surprises U.S. officials. Obama says he's prepared to send military advisers to Iraq but not in a combat role.  August 2014 Obama authorizes "targeted airstrikes" against ISIS outposts in northern Iraq as the militants advance to Irbil, known as a regional capital for the country's ethnic Kurds. About 130 Marines and special operations forces are sent to northern Iraq to help tens of thousands of the minority Yazidi people trapped in the mountains by ISIS, who vow to kill them. "Very specifically, this is not a combat boots on the ground operation," U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says. ISIS is "a credible alternative to al Qaeda," a U.S. intelligence official tells CNN. ISIS shocks the world by releasing its first beheading video of an American -- the victim is journalist James Foley -- and threatens the life of another American captive if Obama doesn't end military operations in Iraq. Other beheading videos will follow later. Meanwhile, Prime Minister al-Maliki withdraws his candidacy for a third term as pressure mounts abroad and at home for him to step down. Replacing him will be Haider al-Abadi, who, like al-Maliki, is a member of the Islamic Dawa Party, one of the country's biggest Shiite political blocs.  September 2014 Obama announces the United States will launch airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria, too. The United States underestimated ISIS and overestimated the Iraqis' military will to fight, Obama says. U.S. Secretary of State Kerry adds the expanded military campaign will take time to degrade ISIS. "There's definitely a second day and there will be a third and more. This is going to go on," Kerry says. Several other countries will join the U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.  February 2015 Obama asks Congress to formally authorize the use of the U.S. military in the war against ISIS, but he doesn't call for ground troops in Iraq or Syria.  April 2015 Iraqi forces, joined by Shiite militiamen, enjoy a victory: They retake the city of Tikrit from ISIS.  May 17, 2015 ISIS scores a victory whose symbolism resonates with Americans: After months of clashes with Iraqi and allied forces, ISIS takes control of the key Iraqi city of Ramadi after government security forces pull out of a military base on the west side. The rise and rise of ISIS Ramadi is 70 miles west of Baghdad. </corpo>

        <titulo>Photographer documents possessions of Chinese families - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-05-18T11:26:36Z</data>
        <autor>Shen Lu, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Beijing (CNN)For more than a decade, Chinese photographer Ma Hongjie has asked dozens of families across the country to empty their homes and pose in front of everything they own. His goal is to tell the stories of those who have been bypassed by China's economic boom -- the people living on the bottom rung of society that haven't enjoyed the fruits of the country's transformation. "The possessions are not even wealth. It's just their lives -- showing how the grassroots try to make a living," said Ma, a photo editor at Chinese National Geography magazine. While the mesmerizing images show a variety of landscapes, lifestyles and cultures, what's most striking is their similarity -- the neatly lined up possessions are mostly daily essentials and tools of trade. Their owners appear proud yet humble. Almost all of Ma's subjects are rural families. He has asked richer families living in cities to participate, but they weren't willing to take part in the project, he said. They possess a lot more, and were afraid of the repercussions of showcasing their wealth, Ma explained. "Yet grassroots were fully at ease showing me whatever they have," he said. "They'd first feel wary about my request, but when I showed the samples they thought it was interesting." Although China now is the second largest economy after the United States, it is also home to the second largest number of poor people in the world, according to the World Bank. Almost 100 million people lived below the national poverty line of $1 a day in 2012.  In his book, which is due to be published later in May, Ma gives the back stories of the families he's photographed. The deepest impression the people he profiled has left upon him is their attitude. Powerless, they never demand anything, Ma said. "Are they satisfied? No. But they have no choice but to accept whatever happens to them," he added. "But they try to live with however little they possess." Although humbling, it also frustrated him. "They suffer from silence." Ma recently revisited the first family he profiled. They lived in a rural town in a mountainous area of Hunan province in southeastern China, back in 2003. To his dismay, nothing had changed in the 10 years since his first visit; their shabby house had become even shabbier, he said. Their sons wanted to get married, but the family couldn't afford to build new homes for them. They had hoped tourism would develop in this old town so that the family would be subsidized for moving out&#8212;then the sons would be able to marry, he said.  Similar stories unfolded everywhere Ma traveled. The Sun family live on boats on the Yellow River that winds through China's heartland. Sun Guiyou, who has been traversing the rivers and lakes for his entire life, says his biggest dream is to one day have a permanent house built on the land. Although the family say they are better off since he first photographed them in 2006, nothing much has changed and they haven't been able to build a home on solid ground. "The way they make a living doesn't change, they are still fishing," he said. "The grandchildren didn't get a good education, or even dropped out of school. You can see them repeating their grandparent's life in the future."  Ma said he was stunned by the diversity of cultures and lifestyles he came across and that it was harrowing to witness these traditions erode. Only a few of the local artisans and performers he met said their offspring were willing to carry on their crafts. Instead, they go to the cities and become migrant workers. When he visited a village in Hainan province in 2010, people lived in small huts. On his return years later, the huts had been replaced by brick and cement dwellings built by the government. In response, the villagers had built new huts next to the government subsidized housing instead, because they were not built in a way that suited their lifestyle. Ventilating smoke from how they cooked meals became difficult in those houses. "The local government thought living in huts was uncivilized, but they were unique," Ma said. "Why should everything be uniform?" The families he documented also shared a hatred of red tape - they bemoaned interference from the local government. So when the government decided to scrap an ancient tradition of taxing farmers for agricultural produce in 2006, farmers and peasants were thrilled by the news. "They simply want to be left alone -- 'Don't make our life so troublesome, let us farm and let us live,' they told me." Ma said. </corpo>

        <corpo>Northern Namibia (CNN)In January 2014, Corey Knowlton bid $350,000 for a permit to hunt and kill a black rhino in Namibia. He won the permit and became a target himself. The hunt is now complete. A rhino is dead. This is how it happened.  Windhoek, Namibia -- Knowlton arrived quietly in Namibia to hunt the famed black rhino. Nearly 18 months ago, the Texas hunter bid $350,000 to kill a black rhinoceros in the southern African country of Namibia. The permit was issued by Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism and auctioned by the Dallas Safari Club. Since then, Knowlton has faced scathing criticism and death threats as the world reacted to the controversial hunt of one of the world's most endangered species. Knowlton has spent the last year and a half preparing and planning the hunt that is being highly scrutinized by animal welfare groups around the world. He agreed to let our CNN crew document the hunt. "At this point, the whole world knows about this hunt and I think it's extremely important that people know it's going down the right way, in the most scientific way that it can possibly happen," Knowlton said after arriving in Africa. Knowlton, 36, from Dallas, wants the world to see that the hunt of such a majestic beast on the African continent is not the work of a bloodthirsty American hunter but a vital component of Namibia's effort to save the animal from extinction. Knowlton's $350,000 will go to fund government anti-poaching efforts across the country. And the killing of an older rhino bull, which no longer contributes to the gene pool but which could harm or kill younger males, is part of the science of conservation, he argues. That's why he says he's doing more to save the black rhino than his critics, and why he wanted us along on this historic hunt. Opponents like the International Fund for Animal Welfare have not been swayed, saying hunting as conservation is a bankrupt notion. "We'll simply never agree with that," fund director Azzedine Downes said. "There's a lot of other things that we can and must do in order to protect these animals." The journey of this hunt will examine the emotional debate raging around the issue of how best to protect endangered species on a continent that is home to some of the most legendary animals on the planet. "I think people have a problem just with the fact that I like to hunt," Knowlton said. "I want to see the black rhino as abundant as it can be. I believe in the survival of the species."  Northern Namibia -- The hunt sets off with a sunrise flight to the region of Namibia where Knowlton will track a black rhino. There's a great deal of concern about news coverage of the hunt in Namibia. We've been told that when our reports are broadcast around the world that Namibian government officials fear poaching syndicates will use the information to identify the location of other black rhinos. For that reason, we have agreed not to report the specific locations of the hunt. According to animal conservationists, there are approximately 5,000 black rhinos in the wild worldwide today, 2,000 of them in Namibia. Hentie van Heerden is a professional hunter hired by the Namibian government to guide Knowlton on the highly scrutinized hunt of the black rhino. Van Heerden, 40, has an international clientele, mostly from Europe, who come to hunt wild game and the exotic animals of Africa. He was born in Namibia and grew up hunting. The thorn-infested terrain in the north of the country does not faze him. He wears sandals even when he hunts the wildest of animals. The bearded van Heerden has the dry sense of humor of a skilled hunter teaching a journalist what to do if we are to stare down a charging rhino. "The aim is to get out of its way without him flattening you," he said. "It's very rare that they come back for seconds and if that is the case, you have to get some more out of its way." Van Heerden says there are a few critics of the black rhino hunt in Namibia, but most people here embrace a culture of hunting. "There will always be activists and that's how they make their money," he said. "They have no clout here in Namibia, because people understand hunting." The hunt is sanctioned and monitored by Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism. It has identified 18 black rhinos across the country that meet the criteria for being hunted and eliminated. The rhino must be an older rhino that is no longer reproducing and is considered a threat to younger, healthier rhinos. Rhinos are intensely territorial and will often kill each other in gruesome fights. Knowlton is targeting one of four black rhinos at the top of the government list, the ones considered "high priority threats to the herd." But identifying these rhinos in the dense brush and in the heat of a dangerous hunt makes Knowlton uneasy, though he will have the help of local trackers and guides. "If it charges at us and we are already sure it's the right one, we are going to kill it," Knowlton said. "If we aren't sure if it's the right one, we are going to try and get out of the way. If we don't feel like we can get out of the way, we got to kill it." That would be the worst-case scenario for Knowlton. For him, the rhino hunt must be carried out flawlessly.  Northern Namibia -- Just after sunrise, Knowlton arrives at a watering hole hidden deep in the Namibian brush to start the hunt. Two government trackers have spotted signs of a rhino heading away from the water. The footprint appears fresh. The weathered wrinkles of the rhino's hide are still visible in the print. The intricate details in the sand suggest the tracks are just a few hours old. The government tracker says, based on the footprints, he can tell this animal is probably one of the black rhinos Knowlton has been permitted to hunt, and that the animal is probably no more than 5 miles away. This is where the hunt begins. The trackers move quickly through the thorny bush and tall grasses. They rarely speak. Quick hand signals are all they need to show the path to follow. Silence is vital when you're tracking a black rhino. The hunting party winds its way through the brush. The rhino's footprints suggests the nearly 3,000 pound (1,360 kilogram) beast is meandering, which tells the hunters it does not feel threatened. As the heat of the day intensifies, rhinos will usually find shady areas to take quick naps. The ranger from the ministry who is observing and leading the trackers says the hunting party is gaining ground on the rhino. But the brush is so dense. Knowlton worries that we could stumble across the rhino at any moment and end up face to face. "I think people think of it as this docile thing," Knowlton said of his prey. "But you are dealing with an extremely athletic animal that can do whatever it wants to you very quickly." The only sounds are the brushes and scrapes of the hunting party cutting through the thorn-infested bushes of this terrain. It seems like every bush has wicked thorns that rip across our skin and clothing. Rhinos have an intense sense of smell and hearing that alerts them to danger from hundreds of yards away. The winds are swirling in the early afternoon hours and the tracker says the rhino can probably sense our presence and is moving away quickly. Knowlton is more concerned with something else. He's been told there are three rhinos known to inhabit the area he's in, but the Namibian government has only authorized the hunting of two of them. Visibility in the brush around us is down to about 15 feet (4.6 meters.) Knowlton is worried that if the rhino charges through the thick brush that he would only have a split second to decide whether to take the shot. It's becoming too risky. We've spent five hours trekking nearly 6 miles through the brush when Knowlton and his hunting partner decide to call it a day. Killing the wrong rhino, Knowlton said, would be a catastrophic mistake. Last year, one of Knowlton's critics suggested the trophy hunting of a black rhino was like shooting a couch in a living room. This criticism annoys Knowlton endlessly. He's quick to bring it up with a heavy dose of sarcasm. "So this is just like hunting a couch? Give me a break," he said. "This isn't easy. It's brutal."  On the road to southern Namibia -- Knowlton decides the hunt in the north is too treacherous. The brush is dense and visibility low. That's a dangerous combination for the hunting party and Knowlton knows that killing the wrong rhino will make him an even bigger target of international outrage. He and his hunting guide decide to drive to southern Namibia to target another dangerous black rhino that lives in a region with better visibility. But on the way we hear that rhino has died, probably of natural causes.  Northern Namibia -- Knowlton returns to the region that makes him the most nervous. And on this morning, the trails are not strong. The trackers have trouble finding prints leading away from the watering holes where the rhinos drink vast amounts of water. It's clear the rhino hunt will not end today.  Northern Namibia -- The morning starts with a startling discovery. Knowlton's professional hunting guide has discovered a camera image showing a rhino at a remote watering hole just before sunrise. The image is stunning. The rhino is more massive than I expected. Its horn is long with a lethal pointed tip. Knowlton spots a large gash in the rhino's ear. It's a crucial identifying mark that tells him instantly this rhino is on the approved government list to be hunted. The hunting party quickly picks up the tracks and disappears into the vicious African bush. The rhino footprints are fresh and light on the sand, telling the trackers the animal is slowly walking, eating grass and taking naps in the shade to avoid the rising sun. Today feels different. There's a sense that just beyond our view we are close to the rhino. The hunting party stops to drink water in the shade of a tree for 20 minutes. When the tracking resumes, Knowlton discovers the spot where the rhino had been resting not moments earlier. You can see the imprint of its wrinkled hide still fresh on the sandy ground. The rhino is close. Knowlton's hands firmly grip his high-powered 500 Nitro Express rifle. Moments later, I see a massive flash of gray leap up over the bushes some 50 feet in front of us. It disappears and you can't tell which direction the rhino is running. It's jarring to see this close how quickly these massive creatures can move. I remember the advice van Heerden, the professional hunting guide, gave me the day before. "You can't outrun the rhino," he said. "If it means to dive into a thorn bush to the left or to the right, we need to get out of its way in a big hurry." Now we can't see the rhino, but we know it's close. Van Heerden tells Knowlton, "He's angry. The next time he will charge." Twenty minutes later as the hunting party moves through the brush, I hear a sound I've not heard before during our trek. The rhino is moving around but it's invisible. It's impossible to grasp how such a beast can move like a ghost in the brush. The hunting party moves single file through a tree line. As the last member of the group emerges, he looks to his left and no more than 40 feet away the rhino is there, staring straight at us. "There it is!" says the last member in the group. It's a breathtaking sight. But this isn't the time to stand and stare. I cut to one side and the rhino starts charging in my direction. "Ed! Get down!" shouts van Heerden. I rush behind Knowlton and his hunting guide. "As soon as you dropped below my gun, I could see the whole animal right behind you," Knowlton would tell me later. I turn around and for a quick flash only see the top half of the rhino in front of us. Then four shots explode through the air. The rhino has been hit at least three times. The hunting party then makes the final push to find the rhino. I've lost track of time. This last push might have taken 30 minutes, it might have taken an hour. It was an incredibly emotional experience. A tracker climbs into a tree and spots the rhino in an open field about 100 yards away. Knowlton gets into position and fires the final shots. The black rhino is dead. Knowlton walks up from behind the rhino and when he's certain it's over, he kneels next to it. "Any time you take an animal's life it's an emotional thing," Knowlton said. The Namibian government official assures Knowlton it is the rhino on the approved hunting list. The trackers smile with relief and shake hands. I ask Knowlton if he still feels that killing this black rhino was the right thing to do and that it will benefit the future of this endangered species. "I felt like from day one it was something benefiting the black rhino," Knowlton reflected just moments after the hunt ended. "Being on this hunt, with the amount of criticism it brought and the amount of praise it brought from both sides, I don't think it could have brought more awareness to the black rhino."

        <titulo>Traitors no more? North Korean defectors 'forgiven' - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN)Kkot-jebi -- literally "flower swallows" -- sounds poetic, but the reality is much harsher. The North Korean term refers to homeless children, fending for themselves without the support of family or state. The word traces it roots back to the aftermath of the Korean War, an imaginative pronunciation of the Russian word "kochevyi," meaning "wandering," and referring to those displaced by the 1950-53 conflict. During the 1990s, North Korea was hit by several years of famine as disastrous harvests laid waste to the land, killing hundreds of thousands, according to conservative estimates. The country's social safety net was reduced to tatters. Families fell apart. And flower swallows re-emerged in large numbers. Although conditions today are much better, North Korea remains desperately poor. Food is in short supply for a large portion of the population -- and kkot-jebi are still very much in existence.  North Korea is one of the most secretive societies in the world. When a CNN team recently visited, our entire schedule was arranged by our official government hosts. Our "minders" accompanied us on every shoot. We had put in certain requests, but we never knew more than a few hours in advance what the next item on our itinerary would be. When we were told to go to a meeting room at our hotel one afternoon, we had no idea who was going to be behind the doors, just something to do with the reality of defectors. When we walked through the doors and saw eight young people sitting on one side of a huge round conference table, we immediately knew who we were to meet.  In early summer 2013, the world's media cried foul over the repatriation of a group of nine North Korea children, then aged between 14 and 19, from Laos. They had been picked up by border security as they were being smuggled from China into Laos by South Korean missionaries, in the hope of getting them resettled in South Korea. READ: Agonizingly close to freedom Pyongyang is not shy about its hatred of defectors. It refers to them in official media as "human scum" and accuses them of criminal acts, lying about their own country for fame and money and abandoning their own families. The decision to return the children was widely condemned. Dire predictions were made about their fate: The children were being sent back to prison; they would face a lifetime of retribution and could even be executed. But here in this room, nearly two years after their return, these former kkot-jebi appear transformed. Four young men dressed in the blue blazers of university students and two boys and two girls in secondary school uniforms, all sat waiting to answer our questions. The ninth member of the group was in a university further away from Pyongyang and could not be brought in at short notice.  They were all children between the ages of 12 and 17 when they crossed into China, separately or in small groups. They only met after they arrived at the missionaries' house. We asked why they left -- it was an uncomfortable opening question. "We were young," said 17-year-old Ri Gwang Hyok. "We just went to China for fun." Pressed for more detail, Mun Chol, 21, admitted: "Frankly, we had some family difficulties. We had been through a period in our history we call 'the arduous march (the years of famine).' We were not living well. I was young and naive. We were living by the Amnok river, which is at the border. I meant to return home. I was curious." We then asked how many of them had experienced hunger before they left. Four of the eight raised their hands. "It was winter. We had preserved food during autumn. But it wasn't enough. Our family was too large," explained Pak Kwang Hyok, 19. Once in China, the children were brought to a house in the border town of Dandong, looked after by a South Korean missionary CNN has called M.J. in previous reports, along with his wife. There, according to M.J., the starving children were transformed. According to the youngsters now, the picture was not so rosy. They said they were kept in the house for a year and a half. "The missionary lectured us about freedom," recalled Mun Chol. "But we weren't given any freedom. He forced us to study God and memorize religious books. "Of course, the food was good," he added, "but that was our only pleasure. When you have food things seem OK, but a kid needs more than that." Following our encounter with the students, CNN contacted M.J., who asked about their well-being. He says he misses them. While hesitant to say much out of fear for their safety, he insists the students needed his help after fleeing North Korea.  China is a historical ally of North Korea, and North Koreans found illegally in the country face deportation if caught. After a year and a half, the missionary decided to move the children to a third country. He chose Laos, on China's southwestern border, from where he hoped he could get them to South Korea. After a harrowing night trek for four hours through the hilly border region, the party were picked up by Laotian police and detained. When they were told they would be sent back to North Korea they were terrified. "The missionary said we would be killed if we went back," said Mun Chol. "He told us our families had been killed because we had left our homes."  But instead of being punished, they tell us they received special treatment, extra tuition to make up for three years of missed schooling, and are now studying in the best educational establishments in the capital. "I was scared," admitted Pak Gwang Hyok. "I had left my home with a guilty conscience and spent time abroad. We had betrayed our country. I thought we would be punished. But now we are studying in the best universities in Pyongyang. Our fears were pretty foolish." Soon after their return, the children appeared on North Korean television to denounce their enticement to defect by South Koreans. Now , more than a year later, they are again on display. They have become poster children for the "benevolence and forgiveness" of the North Korean authorities. There is a huge difference between their lives when they left for China and now. "I feel like a pauper who has become a prince," said Ri Gwang Hyok. But their families have not joined them in Pyongyang, the showcase capital. They remain in the poor border areas and their lives have not changed. When he thinks about what might have happened if he had made it to South Korea, Mun Chol said, "If I had made it, I could have become a traitor -- a bad guy who deserts his family. "I could have gone down in history as one of the 'scum of the earth.'" READ: North Korean: I felt like a slave in Kuwait </corpo>
