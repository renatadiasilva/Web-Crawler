        <corpo>Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)The family of a British boy said they were "devastated and heartbroken" after ISIS apparently released a photo showing their 17-year-old relative smiling in front of an ISIS flag. ISIS media posted images of a boy the group called Abu Yousef al Britani. In one picture, the teen known as Talha Asmal back in England raises his index finger as if he's No. 1. A black flag hangs behind him. In another shot, he's posing inside a black Toyota. The family's heartache played out this weekend against the backdrop of two waves of car bombings in Iraq, notable for the role foreigners were said to have had in them.  Asmal's relatives in West Yorkshire, England, were in shock after British media published the pictures of him. Asmal was a "loving, kind, caring and affable" and had no "ill will against anybody nor did he ever exhibit any violent, extreme or radical views of any kind," his family said in a lengthy statement Sunday. It seems that ISIS targeted the teen and "exploited" his "tender years and naivety," they said, adding that the terror group apparently carried out a "process of deliberate and calculated grooming of him." "As a result of this and completely unbeknown to us, his family, and entirely against our wishes, he ended up traveling it seems to Iraq," the family's statement reads. On Sunday, the United Kingdom's North East Counter Terrorism Unit said that police are aware of media reports that allege a British national has died in Iraq. The identity of the person has not been confirmed, and the office unable to give further comment, it said. "We are aware that large numbers of British nationals are traveling to the Middle East for a variety of reasons, and we understand that some of those traveling have resided in West Yorkshire," it said.  ISIS is known for staging multiple bombings at a single time to rattle its enemy, but this weekend's violence stands out -- the seven car bombers who attacked near the city of Baiji were all from countries outside of Iraq, the terror group claimed. According to ISIS, the attackers were a Brit, a German, a Kuwaiti, a Palestinian, two Dagestanis and one national of Turkmenistan. The bombings happened in two waves. During one, four car bombers raced toward and drove through an Iraqi security forces checkpoint. At least 16 were killed and 29 wounded. In another attack, three car bombers blew themselves up near security forces, causing numerous injuries but no deaths, an Iraqi Security Forces paramilitary commander told CNN. The commander told CNN that in the first attack security forces mistook four speeding SUVs heading toward them as a convoy escorting a high-level official. Violence in Iraq continued Sunday. A parked car exploded near a shopping area in Shaab, a predominantly Shia district northern Baghdad. Two people were killed and seven wounded, police told CNN.  Other families around the world share in the pain Asmal's family is experiencing. British teens have been swept up in the allure of ISIS. Earlier this year, three teenage British girls were seen on airport surveillance footage heading to Syria. A Scottish teenager wrote extensively on her Tumblr account about her love of ISIS. She stunned her family, left her country and became an ISIS bride and recruiter. An American teenager from suburban Chicago, Mohammed Hamzah Khan, allegedly was on his way to join ISIS in October when he was stopped at an airport. Asmal's family said he comes from a "close knit, hardworking, peace loving and law abiding British Muslim family." "It appears Talha fell under the spell of individuals who continued to prey on his innocence and vulnerability," they said. If he was one of the suicide bombers, the boy was "ordered to his death by so called ISIS handlers and leaders too cowardly to do their own dirty work," they said. ISIS does not represent Islam, they stressed. "They do not represent in any way, shape or form Islam and Muslims and we are no longer prepared to allow a barbaric group like ISIS to hijack our faith," their statement said. "ISIS Not and Never in our name." They are grieving, they said, and need a break from talking to reporters. They need "time and understanding to come to terms," they said, "with our unimaginable and painful loss." CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Baghdad while Ashley Fantz wrote the story in Atlanta.

        <titulo>North Korean soldier defects across border, South says - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Seoul, South Korea (CNN)A North Korean soldier defected to South Korea on Monday across the heavily fortified border that separates the two countries, South Korean authorities said. The soldier crossed the Military Demarcation Line on foot from the eastern North Korean province of Gangwon, said a South Korean Defense Ministry official, who declined to be identified. Further details on the circumstances of the defection weren't immediately available. There was no reaction to the news on North Korean state media.  The border between North and South Korea is considered to be the most heavily militarized in the world. The two countries technically remain at war, because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armed truce and not a peace treaty. North Korean soldiers have occasionally made it across the highly sensitive zone in the past. In 2012, one managed to cross the border unnoticed and knock on the door of a South Korean barracks, embarrassing the South Korean military and prompting a public apology from the defense minister at the time for the security lapse. But defections directly across the border from North to South Korea are rare.  Most people attempt to flee the impoverished, oppressively ruled North by crossing the more open border into China and then trying to make their way to South Korea through other countries. More than 26,000 refugees from the North have reached the South since the end of the Korean War, according to the Unification Ministry in Seoul. The vast majority of them arrived during the past 15 years. But defection has become harder in recent years, the Unification Ministry says, and the number of people doing it has fallen significantly since Kim Jong Un succeeded his father as the North Korean leader.  Separately, North Korea on Monday said it was willing to hold talks with the South -- but with conditions attached. "If an atmosphere of trust and reconciliation is created between North and South Korea, there is no reason not to hold dialogue and negotiation between the two sides," a North Korean government statement carried by state media said. The conditions it set out included its often repeated call for South Korea to stop holding joint military exercises with the United States, a request that Seoul and Washington have consistently dismissed.  Pyongyang also told Seoul on Monday that it plans to release two South Korean citizens this week, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry. North Korea said the two South Koreans -- a man in his late 50s with the surname Lee, and a woman in her early 50s with the surname Jin -- illegally entered North Korea on May 11. North Korea detained them the same month. The South Korean government said it believes the two went missing while traveling in China near the North Korean border. It expects to collect them Wednesday morning at Panmunjom, the "truce village" that straddles the border between the two Koreas. CNN's K.J. Kwon and journalist Jung-eun Kim reported from Seoul, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.</corpo>

        <titulo>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-15T00:41:30Z</data>
        <autor>Eliott C. McLaughlin and Dave Gilbert, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. What's next for Philae? At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35&#186;C and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear mission managers on Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life </corpo>

        <titulo>Mokhtar Belmokhtar: Al Qaeda figure a legend among jihadists - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-15T03:55:32Z</data>
        <autor>Tim Lister, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)The reported killing of veteran al Qaeda figure Mokhtar Belmokhtar in a U.S. airstrike in Libya represents an extraordinary intelligence achievement against one of the most elusive and powerful jihadists in North Africa. According to the Libyan interim government, Belmokhtar was killed in eastern Libya in an airstrike Saturday. In a statement issued late Sunday, the government said the strike targeted Belmokhtar "and a group of Libyans who are members of a terrorist organization in Eastern Libya." It said the operation "took place after consultations with the Libyan Government." A U.S. official told CNN that Belmokhtar was "the intended target" of the operation, but no proof of his death has been provided by either government. Both the United States and France have been hunting Belmokhtar for years. He was designated as a global terrorist by the United States 12 years ago, and there was a $5 million reward on offer for information about him. If, as Libyan sources indicate, the strike was carried out close to the Mediterranean coast, it was several hundred miles away from Belmokhtar's home turf -- the vast and empty desert where Libya, Niger and Algeria meet. It's an area where for years Belmokhtar combined lucrative smuggling operations with ambitious terrorist attacks, becoming a leading figure in the often fractured group known as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM.)  But Belmokhtar is thought to have visited Libya before. In the aftermath of Moammar Gadhafi's overthrow in 2011, he established relationships with some of the more militant Libyan groups that were emerging. And he formed an elite unit called "Those Who Sign With Blood" specifically to attack Western interests in the Sahel and North Africa. Sources in direct contact with Western intelligence agencies told CNN in the spring of 2013 that Belmokhtar had been in Libya for four months from December 2011. They say his visit was facilitated by the leader of a radical Islamist militia with influence in Benghazi and the East. According to the sources, he met a Libyan veteran of jihad in Afghanistan who had set up camps near Sabha in southern Libya providing training for jihadists from Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania and Mali as well as Libyans and ethnic Tuaregs. Belmokhtar made his intentions clear in a 28-minute video released in December 2012, warning Western governments: "This is a promise from us that we will fight you in the midst of your countries, and we will attack your interests." A month later, his group - the Al-Mulathameen Brigade (The Brigade of the Masked Ones) -- launched its most ambitious attack yet against the In Amenas gas facility in eastern Algeria. Nearly forty workers, most of them foreigners, were killed in a three-day occupation of the plant. Western intelligence officials believe that camps in Libya may have been used by the group. In Amenas is 50 kilometers from the Libyan border, and the group traveled through southern Libya on their way to the plant, according to counterterrorism officials. A spokesman for Al-Mulathameen told Mauritanian news websites that the attack was in retaliation for Algeria permitting French overflights as part of its military intervention in Mali against AQIM, which at that point had taken over nearly half the country.  Some sources also connected Belmokhtar to the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound and annex in Benghazi in September 2012, in which Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed. Shortly after the attack, a phone call was placed from the area, according to two sources with high-level access to Western intelligence agencies who spoke to CNN early in 2013. Whoever made the call was excited. "Mabruk, Mabruk!" he repeated, meaning "Congratulations" in Arabic, according to the sources. They told CNN the call was made to a senior figure in AQIM. There was no proof that the call was specifically about the attack, but the sources say that is the assumption among those with knowledge of the call. One of the sources says the phone call was discovered when a Western intelligence service trawled through intercepts of communications made in the wake of the attack. That source told CNN that the call was made to Belmokhtar. The CIA had no comment on the alleged call. Whether Belmokhtar was linked to the Benghazi attack or not, he was fast climbing the "most wanted" list. Federal prosecutors in the United States filed charges against him in 2013, including conspiracy, hostage-taking, kidnapping, providing material support to al Qaeda, and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction  Belmokhtar was a legendary figure among jihadists, but always his own man. Born in 1972, he grew up on the edge of the desert in southern Algeria and traveled to Afghanistan in 1991 to fight its then Communist government. He returned to Algeria as a hardened fighter with a new nickname "Belaouar" -- the "one-eyed" -- after he lost an eye in battle. For a time in the 1990s he fought with the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) in its brutal campaign against the Algerian regime and civilians deemed to be its supporters -- and became the GIA commander for the Sahara. He then joined a group that was the forerunner of AQIM but frequently fell out with other leaders, who saw him as a loose cannon. That was probably in part because of Belmokhtar's smuggling and kidnapping rackets, which netted his group tens of millions of dollars. He gained the nickname "Mr Marlboro" because of cigarette smuggling, and his group kidnapped a Canadian diplomat, Robert Fowler, in 2008, among many other foreign workers. It also moved drugs and illegal migrants and bought plenty of weapons and alliances with the proceeds. His activities were too much for Abdelmalik Drukdal, the overall leader of AQIM, who is said to have demoted Belmokhtar in 2012 from his position as "Emir of the Sahel." Citing regional security officials, Agence France Presse reported at the time that Belmokhtar had been dismissed for "continued divisive activities, despite several warnings." More recently, AQIM has further fractured over whether to swear allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS.) Belmokhtar's group had joined with two others to form an organization called al-Murabitoon, but when one faction declared for ISIS and Abu Bakr al Baghdadi last month, Belmokhtar quickly rejected the change. "We confirm our commitment and loyalty to the pledge of allegiance to Sheikh Ayman al-Zawahiri," his group announced on May 14th. Belmokhtar survived as long as he did because of the vast distances and empty landscapes of the Sahel: the rugged Algerian-Malian frontier is as long as the distance from New York to Chicago. He knew the region, its tracks and passes, intimately. The French intervention in Mali appears to have pushed Belmokhtar north from his previous hunting grounds into Niger and southern Libya. He was able to take advantage of the complete collapse of government in Libya and the weapons bazaar that emerged there after Gadhafi's fall. But it seems that he was more frequently on the move, relying on a variety of Libyan allies. And that made him more vulnerable to being tracked and targeted.

        <titulo>Paraguay: We're protecting life of pregnant 10-year-old - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Paraguay's foreign ministry says it doesn't need to follow steps recommended by an international human rights committee that weighed in recently on how the country is handling the case of a 10-year-old pregnant girl who was allegedly raped by her stepfather. In a statement released Sunday, the foreign ministry said it rejects a list of demands from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights about what it should do to protect the life of the girl. Paraguay already "has taken all the appropriate measures to avoid impunity for the wrongful act committed and to ensure the life and safety of this girl and the fetus," the statement said. Last week, the human rights commission, which is part of the Organization of American States, cited recent testimony from U.N. experts saying Paraguay's government had "failed in its responsibility to protect a 10-year old sexual abuse survivor and provide her with critical and timely treatments, including a 'safe and therapeutic' abortion." At issue is Paraguayan law, which bans abortions except in cases where the pregnancy endangers the mother's life. The Paraguayan Ministry of Health has said there's no indication that the health of the girl is at risk. But the human rights commission said that the girl, now 26 weeks pregnant, is facing a serious health situation with a significant possibility of complications. It criticized the Paraguayan government for not releasing enough information about the case and questioned whether the girl and her family were being provided enough information about the situation and the significant medical risks. The mother of the minor has been imprisoned, charged with breaching her care of duty. Last month, police arrested the girl's 42-year old stepfather, accusing him of raping of the child. He denied this accusations. The case has drawn international attention and sparked debate on the largely taboo issue of incest in South America. According to data from UNICEF, in Paraguay, every day two girls from the ages of 10 and 14 give birth to a baby that is the result of sexual abuse. Paraguay's Ministry of Health says that in 2014, over 680 minors from the ages of 10 to 14 reported a pregnancy. Paraguay has a population of 6.7 million.

        <corpo>(CNN)A U.S. plane carried out a strike inside Libya on Sunday, reportedly killing a key terror figure in North Africa, U.S. and Libyan officials said. The target was Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a veteran Islamist fighter affiliated with al Qaeda in North Africa, a U.S. official told CNN. The Libyan government said Belmokhtar was killed in the strike, something that U.S. officials have not confirmed. Federal prosecutors in New York had charged the one-eyed Belmokhtar in 2013 with crimes related to a brazen attack on a gas facility in Algeria were 37 hostages died. Three Americans were among the dead. "It was a single strike conducted by a manned aircraft," a Pentagon official with direct knowledge of the operation told CNN. There were no U.S. personnel on the ground, the official said. U.S. aerial intelligence assets were tracking Belmokhtar's movements at the time of the raid, the U.S. official said, but the outcome of the operation was still being assessed. The Libyan government went further in a statement Sunday, saying that the U.S. airstrike "led to the killing of Moktar Belmokhtar and a group of Libyans who are members of a terrorist organization in Eastern Libya." The strike happened at 2 a.m. Sunday (8 p.m. ET Saturday). In New York, Belmokhtar was charged on various conspiracy counts including hostage-taking, kidnapping, providing material support to al Qaeda and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction.  Belmokhtar is the founder of the Signed-in-Blood Battalion, also known as the al-Mulathamun Battalion. The group claimed responsibility for the January 2013 attack in Algeria. In the Algerian siege, heavily armed militants in pickups struck a sprawling state-owned natural gas complex near In Amenas, gathered the Westerners who worked there into a group and tied them up. Belmokhtar had said the attack was in retaliation for Algeria allowing France to use its airspace to battle Islamist militants in Mali. The Algerian military tried to negotiate with the militants during the standoff, but their demands to release militants held prisoner in Algeria were deemed unreasonable, leading to intervention by special forces troops. The gas facility operated in cooperation with foreign energy firms such as Norway's Statoil and Britain's BP -- and as such, employed workers from several Western countries.

        <corpo>(CNN)Nine days and hundreds of tips later, the convicted killers are still out there. Despite the efforts of 800 law enforcement officials, popping open trucks, peering into cars and scouring heavily wooded areas, authorities are no closer to capturing Richard Matt and David Sweat. "We don't know if they are still in the immediate area or if they are in Mexico by now," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday. With every passing day since they escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York, hopes of capturing them fade. But the leads keep piling up, more than 870 of them so far, according to New York State Police. They involve a mishmash of far-flung places: Vermont, Mexico, even a few miles from maximum-security facility in Dannemora, which they escaped from on June 6. With every credible tip comes a switch in direction. "We had a lead that they were headed to the state of Vermont and ... I called the governor of Vermont and we worked out a cooperative agreement with Vermont," Cuomo said. "We then received information that they may be just a few miles from the prison, because there was a house that was broken into and it was suspect, so we followed up on that. Yesterday, we had over 800 people searching quadrants in an area where we had a tip that they might be."  As the search for the two convicts drags on, the woman who allegedly helped them will appear in court Monday. Prison tailor Joyce Mitchell has been sitting in jail since last week, accused of helping the pair break out of their cells. The two have been on the run since they were discovered missing from the Clinton Correctional Facility. Prison officials noticed they were nowhere to be found during a 5:30 a.m. bed check. While making their escape, they slipped through holes and cut into a steel plate and a steam pipe, then got out through a manhole and onto a street.  Mitchell supplied them with various tools, including hacksaw blades, chisels, a punch and a screwdriver bit, according to court records. But that was not all, said Andrew Wylie, the Clinton County district attorney. After their escape, the two convicts planned to drive seven hours under the cover of darkness to a predetermined location, together with Mitchell, he said. Mitchell told investigators she was supposed to pick them up but got cold feet, Wylie said. The plan was to run off with the men after picking them up near a manhole where they'd emerge from a network of tunnels, according to Wylie. "They were going to meet down by the power plant, drive -- I'm not going to say into the sunset, because it was after midnight and it was dark out -- but they were going to drive, potentially to an area that was about seven hours away," he said.  Mitchell told authorities that the pair picked a destination, but they did not give her any specifics. "That was the information that she was told by Matt and Sweat -- that it was about seven hours away," Wylie said. After her change of heart, she began cooperating with police, authorities said. "She did indicate one of the reasons why she didn't show up was because she did love her husband and she didn't want to do this to him," Wylie said. But the prisoners may have been manipulating Mitchell from as far back as 2013, when the trio met, he said. Mitchell has told investigators that Matt made her feel "special," a source familiar with the investigation said. State Department of Corrections officials had received a complaint about the relationship between Mitchell and one of the two escapees. The department didn't find enough evidence to support the complaint, but that does not mean there was no relationship, Wylie said. The governor said the state will have "zero tolerance" for any prison employee involvement. "To the extent any state employee was involved in facilitating the escape, that is a crime in and of itself, and that will be fully prosecuted as a crime in and of itself," Cuomo said.  More than 800 state, local and federal law enforcement officers are searching for the escapees, New York State Police said. The manhunt for the convicts has expanded in Plattsburgh, in upstate New York, where authorities have shut a portion of State Route 374. Tracking dogs picked up their scent last week at a gas station in the town, where authorities believe they were rummaging through trash at a sandwich shop. But it's unclear when they were there. The local Saranac Central School District canceled classes last week as the search intensified. Classes resume Monday, but with enhanced police presence on campuses during school hours, New York State Police said. It said there will be no outdoor activities. Sweat was serving a life sentence with no chance of parole for the murder of a Broome County sheriff's deputy in 2002. Matt was sentenced to 25 years to life for the kidnapping and murder of a man in 1997. Mitchell may not face as much time, but she's looking at eight years behind bars if she is convicted. She pleaded not guilty Friday night to a felony charge of promoting prison contraband and a misdemeanor charge of criminal facilitation. CNN's Sara Ganim contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>South Korea MERS death toll rises to 16 - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Seoul, South Korea (CNN)In one sign of a possible return to normalcy, thousands of schools across South Korea re-opened on Monday after closures due to the deadly MERS outbreak. But it came with heightened awareness; children's temperatures were monitored in classrooms and teachers warned students to practice personal hygiene and frequently wash their hands. Not all schools have reopened; 440 remain shut as officials seek to stop the spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The World Health Organization had recommended re-opening institutions last week because transmission of the virus had not been linked to schools.  Nearly four weeks into the South Korean outbreak, cases and deaths continued to mount on Monday. Five new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have been confirmed in South Korea, bringing the total to 150. Another person also died from the virus, raising the MERS death toll to 16, according to the country's Ministry of Health. The outbreak has sparked international concern, stalled the nation's economy and resulted in over 100,000 canceled tourist visits to the country. Korea's department store sales tumbled 16.5% compared with the same period last year and retail shops also decreased 3.4%, according to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. The ongoing situation has put Korean authorities under scrutiny for their inability to contain MERS cases and President Park Geun-hye has seen her approval ratings plummet.  In a news conference Monday, the Ministry of Health announced that a special task force had been sent to South Korea's second largest city, Busan, after learning that one of the most recently diagnosed MERS patient had visited several hospitals and clinics in the area. "We are doing our best to stop the spread of MERS," said the Korean minister of health. "We are analyzing the CCTV with the help of Busan police," referring to tracking down who had been at the hospitals. On Sunday, a 61-year-old man died in a Busan hospital with MERS. South Korean health officials along with a WHO team said this weekend, that the outbreak was slowing, but additional cases were expected. READ: Should you be worried about MERS?  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has recorded five cases of MERS in the past week, the official state-run Saudi press agency said Sunday, citing a weekly Ministry of Health statement. It included one death of a 73-year-old man who died in the city of Turaba and had a pre-existing condition. The strain of coronavirus that causes MERS was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, according to the WHO. The man believed to be "patient zero" in the current outbreak in South Korea visited Saudi Arabia in May, along with three other Middle Eastern countries. That 68-year-old patient went from facility-to-facility near or around Seoul before getting properly diagnosed. It triggered the hospital-based transmission of MERS in South Korea. The South Korean outbreak is the largest outside of Saudi Arabia -- over 5,000 people remain in quarantine.  In Seoul, Samsung Medical Center -- one of the city's hospitals that has counted many of the nation's MERS cases among its patients and visitors -- announced Sunday that it will suspend all surgical procedures except for emergency surgery "to fully focus on responding to MERS." More than 50 confirmed MERS cases have been traced back to the medical center, according to the center's website. The medical center, located in Seoul's glitzy Gangnam district and considered one of the most prominent hospitals in the capital, issued an apology for its handling of MERS. "We sincerely apologize with our heads bent to the people for causing great concern as Samsung Medical Center became the center (of) the spread of MERS," hospital President Song Jae-hoon said. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul. CNN's Anas Hamdan reported from Atlanta. Journalists Jung-eun Kim and Han Sol, and CNN's Kay Guerrero and Khushbu Shah contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>Migrant organization: Australia shirking obligations - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>(CNN)The Australian government stands accused of shirking its international obligations to migrants following allegations it paid people smugglers to turn back a boat full of people seeking asylum. The country's immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said that his government would honor its international commitments. "We will act within the law; we will act within our international obligations," he told reporters Sunday. However, migrant advocates have said that, should the allegations prove true, Australia is shirking its international obligations. "Clearly helping people smugglers is not something that is supported by international conventions," Leonard Doyle, spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), told CNN's John Vause. "Indeed if they're traffickers by this point then that is something that would not be supported by anybody but we have to see what the facts are."  The United Nations refugee agency's report cited firsthand accounts of people on board a ship that was diverted to Indonesia after coming in contact with Australian authorities. The boat -- carrying 65 migrants from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar -- was intercepted by the Indonesian navy after turning back from Australia on May 31, the UNHCR said. The migrants were transferred to an Indonesian customs vessel for four days before being sent on two boats to Indonesia, the UNHCR added, after speaking to some of the passengers. Australia has refused to confirm or deny the payment, and Prime Minister Tony Abbott went on the defensive Friday when asked about the claim. Abbott refused to "comment on operational matters," but said that the government would stop the boats "by hook or by crook."  Along with Australian opposition politicians, Indonesia's foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, has demanded a response from the Abbott administration and said she had taken up the issue with Australia's ambassador to Jakarta. A ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir told Australia's ABC News that Indonesia would investigate the UNHCR allegations. "Of course on Australia's push-back policy we have been consistently saying they are on a slippery slope," ABC reported him as saying. "Should this situation (be) confirmed ... it would be a new low." Speaking with reporters Sunday, Abbott again avoided giving a direct answer as to whether Australia had paid people smugglers to turn boats around. "There's really only one thing to say here... and that is we have stopped the boats," CNN affiliate Sky News reported Abbott as saying. "That's good for Australia, it's good for Indonesia and it's particularly good for all of those who want to see a better world because if the boats start again, the deaths start again. None of us should want to see deaths at sea and the only way to ensure that the boats stay stopped. It's important that the Indonesians know that the Australian government is absolutely resolute in our determination never to see this evil trade start up again." Relations between Indonesia and Australia remain strained following the execution of two Australian nationals, part of the so-called Bali 9 group of drug smugglers, in April. Australia recalled its ambassador from Jakarta following the incident.  There are concerns that the plight of genuine refugees is being politicized by governments like Abbott's. "At the end of the day migration is a complex issue. It's often reduced to political slogans and it's certainly not something to be managed through sloganeering. We can't just lock the door on people," IOM's Doyle told CNN. "Around the world it's a phenomenon that needs collaboration and not simply closing the door on the problem." </corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)A 13-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy each lost an arm Sunday in separate shark attacks at the same North Carolina beach. Oak Island Mayor Betty Wallace told CNN that the female swimmer was attacked first, around 4:15 p.m. Less than 90 minutes later, as responders were still tending to her, the boy was then attacked. Both victims were airlifted to New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington. Both arrived in critical condition, according to hospital spokeswoman Martha Harlan. Harlan said they've each had an arm amputated; his below the shoulder, hers at the elbow. The female also sustained serious tissue damage to her leg, according to Harlan. Both patients -- whose names are not being released -- have since been upgraded to fair condition. Wallace told CNN that shark attacks are so rare at Oak Island -- a southerly facing beach town on the state's southern most coast -- that she couldn't remember one occurring before Sunday. Witness Jason Hunter told CNN affiliate WWAY that the shark in the attack on the boy was seven or eight feet long. And although the mayor said they are not certain, "common sense would tell you it was the same shark," she said. Both incidents occurred at high tide in the vicinity of Ocean Crest Pier, a popular destination among beach goers. "At the pier this time of year, I'm sure the beach was packed," said Wallace. The pier is also a popular spot to fish from, meaning there was likely bait in the water that would could have attracted sharks. Fire Chief Chris Anselmo told CNN that beaches will remain open Monday. The sheriff's office will have helicopters monitoring the coastline. Oak Island is home to about 7,000 residents. But the population swells to about 25,000 during the summer with beach visitors, Anselmo said. CNN's Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>Group: Arrest Sudan's Omar al-Bashir at AU summit - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-14T20:16:57Z</data>

        <corpo>(CNN)The International Criminal Court's six-year quest to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on charges of war crimes and genocide took a step closer to reality Sunday after he arrived at the African Union summit in South Africa. The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria barred al-Bashir from leaving the country while hearings determine the fate of the ICC arrest warrant, a spokesman for the legal team seeking his detention told CNN. The state asked Judge Hans Fabricius to delay proceedings until Sunday afternoon to give it time to prepare its arguments, and the judge agreed, Kaajal Ramjathan-Keogh of the Southern Africa Litigation Centre said from the high court. Lawyers for the litigation center asked for a court order that would prevent al-Bashir from leaving South Africa until the court delivered its decision, and Fabricius granted that motion as well, Ramjathan-Keogh said. Fabricius wants to determine whether it's legally acceptable for Pretoria to allow al-Bashir to visit South Africa without arresting him, and key in that decision will be determining if the South African Cabinet's decision not to comply with the ICC demand can trump an international treaty, South Africa's Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper reported. The state-run South African Government News Agency said there was no official government response to "the reports that dominated the media on Sunday" and addressed the issue only in the last paragraph of a story about the Johannesburg summit getting started. c Sidiki Kaba, the Senegalese justice minister who serves as president of the assembly of states parties to the Rome Statute of the ICC, "expresses his deep concern about the negative consequences for the Court in case of nonexecution of the warrants by States Parties and, in this regard, urges them to respect their obligations to cooperate with the Court." South Africa should "spare no effort" to arrest al-Bashir, Kaba said in a statement. South Africa has twice before threatened to arrest al-Bashir: in 2009 ahead of President Jacob Zuma's inauguration and in 2010 before the World Cup, according to the Southern Africa Litigation Centre. He attended neither event, according to news reports. Ahead of the summit, the center wondered whether al-Bashir or Egyptian President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi would attend. The Muslim Lawyers Association filed a warrant with South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority demanding Egypt's former military chief be arrested on charges that he committed war crimes during the 2013 overthrow of President Mohamed Morsy. El-Sisi faces no ICC indictment, but Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb attended the summit instead, according to numerous media reports. The summit poses a tricky situation in that the African Union invited all but one of the continent's leaders -- the Central African Republic's Catherine Samba-Panza -- to the summit and has "adopted an official policy which requires its member states not to cooperate with the ICC as it is regarded as biased against Africa since all its indictments to date have been against African individuals," the Southern Africa Litigation Centre said. Al-Bashir, a former Army colonel who came to power via a 1989 coup, stands accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, the updated 2013 ICC arrest warrant states. Arrest warrants from 2009 and 2010 outline the case against al-Bashir and allege that during the Darfur conflict he ordered the military, police and Janjaweed militia to attack three ethnic groups deemed sympathetic to rebel outfits with "the specific intent to destroy in part" those groups. As part of that campaign, the warrants say, the Sudanese president ordered the rape, murder and torture of civilians and the razing of villages. The U.N. has estimated that as many as 300,000 people have been killed in the Darfur conflict since 2003, a tally the Sudanese government says is inflated. Another 7 million are in need of humanitarian assistance, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates. Putting a face on refugee crisis On Wednesday, the U.N. assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations told the Security Council that the ongoing violence in Darfur was having a "devastating" impact on civilians. More than 78,000 civilians have been displaced this year alone, the U.N. reports. CNN's Brent Swails contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>What next for Philae, the comet lander that woke up? - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-15T09:21:53Z</data>
        <autor>Dave Gilbert, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>London (CNN)Scientists working on the Rosetta comet mission look like they are about to reap the bonus of the bounce after the little lander Philae phoned home at the weekend. Contact was lost with the probe in November when its initial battery charge drained after 60 hours on the surface of Comet 67P. It was originally hoped that after the initial experiments, Philae would operate until March this year when the fierce heat of the sun would likely burn out its components. But in what appears to be a happy accident, the probe, which is about the size of a washing machine, bounced across the comet's surface in the weak gravity after anchor devices failed, and it landed in a sheltered spot. There wasn't enough sunlight to recharge its batteries but it was protected from the worst of the solar scorching. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Now, as the comet gets closer to the sun, there is enough power to allow the lander to emerge from its dormant state and make contact with the orbiting Rosetta. "I was thrilled," lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN shortly after contact was re-established with Philae. "We are all delighted. Delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity ... allows us to do more science." It now means Philae can continue with experiments up to and beyond the comet's closest approach to the sun in mid-August -- called perihelion. "It's a bonus," said O'Rourke. "It's incredible that we have a chance to get data from the surface of a comet approaching perihelion. We weren't expecting that." O'Rourke explained that Philae's two mass memories are full, suggesting that the probe was awake for a few days before making a successful link with the orbiter. He said the team will now try to retrieve all the data so the memory can be cleared and they can concentrate on gathering near real-time information from the craft -- especially its precise location and orientation. Experiments that couldn't be carried out in November will be a priority, he said. Rosetta and its mission The European Space Agency (ESA), which is leading a consortium that includes NASA to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun, has already notched up some notable firsts with the project. It is the first time a mission has successfully orbited a comet, following it on its journey around the sun, and the first time a controlled landing has been made on a comet -- even though Philae encountered a bumpy ride. And the Rosetta mission has already discovered organic chemicals on the comet surface. As the comet gets closer to the sun, it will become more active with material being blasted away to form the comet's distinct tail. The orbiter has been recording dramatic pictures of this activity for weeks. This could cause problems for Philae but O'Rourke is confident it will survive and continue collecting more data from the surface. "I think we know that Philae is in a quiet location. I'm reasonably sure it's going to survive perihelion," he said. And what of Rosetta's future? O'Rourke told CNN that the orbiter will descend to within five kilometers (three miles) of the comet's surface and return images of amazing detail. But he said they are also proposing extending the mission to September next year when an attempt will be made to spiral Rosetta down to the comet to be parked on its surface. He said a decision was due to made in the next two weeks. Unlike Philae, Rosetta has many thruster rockets that can help reduce its speed and attitude -- reducing the risk of another bouncy landing. So could Rosetta survive another six years in its marathon comet-chasing mission and return fresh data from the comet's next return in six years? "That's the million-dollar question -- but I would think the chances are very low," said O'Rourke. But given the enduring nature of the mission to date, have the twin probes got a few more surprises still to reveal? We are likely to learn more in the coming weeks as perihelion approaches.

        <corpo>(CNN)Wild animals roamed the streets of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, on Sunday, after raging floodwaters damaged the city's zoo and set many of the animals free. Twelve people died in the flooding, according to Civil Georgia, a news website run by the nongovernmental organization UN Association of Georgia. Several others were missing, and wolves, bears, big cats and even a hippopotamus were wandering the streets of the city, according to Civil.ge, a news agency funded by the EU and the UN. Of the zoo's 600 residents, including fish and birds, about half were missing on Sunday, theTbilisi Zoo said. Some animals have been recaptured, Civil.ge reported. Others have been killed.  But some animals were still roaming loose. Video from the city shows what appears to be a crocodile slithering down the city streets, as well as a hippopotamus standing around looking confused. Also among the escapees were lions, tigers, bears and wolves, the agency reported. Georgia's prime minister, Irakli Garibashvili, asked residents to stay home while the animals are rounded up. The Ministry of Internal Affairs also urged everyone to stay indoors but said in a statement that the situation was "under full control." All efforts are being made to find the animals quickly, "give them injections," and get them back into the zoo, the ministry said. Two employees of the zoo were among the fatalities.  The problems began before midnight Saturday. Heavy rainfall turned the Vere River, normally little more than a stream through the center of Tbilisi, into a torrent, the news agency reported. The raging river flooded significant portions of a highway, swept away cars and at least one small house, and flooded many other homes. Images on Tbilisi City Hall's Facebook page showed roads washed out, hillsides collapsed and vehicles tossed about like toys.

        <titulo>Prisoner-staff relationships in spotlight after escape - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>(CNN)The charges against a prison tailor accused of helping two convicted murders escape from a maximum security facility in upstate New York have cast a spotlight on relationships between inmates and correctional staff. The nature of Joyce Mitchell's ties to Richard Matt and David Sweat, the two murderers who are still on the lam, remains unclear. But hundreds of consensual relationships between guards and inmates are documented each year in U.S. prisons, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. More than half of all substantiated incidents of staff sexual misconduct in U.S. prisons and jails were committed by female members of staff, according to a study by the bureau released last year. Prison authorities face the challenge of monitoring a complex web of interactions. "I understand prisons run on a delicate balance, and having a good relationship between guards and the inmates, guards and the employees, employees and inmates is important," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said over the weekend. "But there's a line. And when the line is stepped over, then action has to be taken." Some of the high-profile cases have drawn national attention.  Nancy Gonzalez, a night guard at a federal prison in Brooklyn, was sentenced last year to a year in prison for having an unlawful relationship with Ronell Wilson, a convicted cop killer on death row. "People find love in the strangest places," her attorney, Anthony Ricco, said during the case. "And people get together in the most difficult circumstances. We live in a society where these events happen. These types of cases are unusual, but they're not uncommon." Gonzalez gave birth to Wilson's child in 2013.  In the upstate New York case, it's not clear what kind of involvement Mitchell might have had with Matt and Sweat. She told investigators that she had planned to drive off into the night with the two men after they broke out of the prison. But she got cold feet, decided not to pick them up and later began cooperating with police, according to Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie. The manipulation of Mitchell, he said, may go as far back as 2013, when the trio met. She has told investigators that Matt made her feel "special," a source familiar with the investigation said. State Department of Corrections officials had previously received a complaint about the relationship between Mitchell and one of the two escapees. The department didn't find enough evidence to support the complaint, but that does not mean there was no relationship, Wylie said.  Mitchell, who is accused of supplying the murderers with the tools to cut through prison walls, pleaded not guilty Friday night to a felony charge of promoting prison contraband and a misdemeanor charge of criminal facilitation. Family members have disputed the allegations that she helped the two murderers and planned to run off with them. Her husband and prison co-worker, Lyle Mitchell, is also under investigation, but has not been arrested or charged, authorities said. He worked in the maintenance department at the tailoring block where his wife was employed, Wylie said. "She did indicate one of the reasons why she didn't show up was because she did love her husband and she didn't want to do this to him," Wylie said.  One woman who did disappear with a convicted murderer was Bobbi Parker, the wife of a prison warden in Oklahoma. She and the inmate, Randolph Dial, went missing in 1994. More than a decade later, authorities found them living together in Texas. Parker said Dial had drugged and kidnapped her, but prosecutors said the two had fallen in love. She was found guilty of assisting his escape and served half of a one-year sentence.  Experts say people, particularly women, can be drawn to criminals imprisoned for heinous acts for various reasons. "There's a term, hybristophilia, which indicates that being around somebody that's very dangerous can be sexually arousing," said Joy Krause, who made a film about prison relationships, "Serial Killer Groupies: A Love Story." "Other people are just very lonely," she told CNN. "Some women like to have a long distance pen pal relationship. There are many, many reasons." The challenges that prison presents to physical intimacy serve as an attraction for some women. "They get to be in love with them, pen pals with them, they can even marry them in prison but they don't have to have physical contact or sex with them," said criminologist Casey Jordan. Lengthy prison sentences also -- usually -- mean the inmate isn't going to disappear off anywhere. "It's the ultimate in safety," Jordan said. </corpo>

        <titulo> African bees are all the buzz -- for positive reasons  - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)Africanized bees, known as "killer bees," once gained notoriety in the United States for swarming and killing. But while Africa's bees tend to be more aggressive than their European or American counterparts, their aggression also makes them more productive and resilient. The International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi is working to utilize the African bee and its aggression to the continent's advantage. "We have found in our previous studies that bees in Africa are a bit resistant, they are resilient to the bee pests," said Dr. Suresh Raina, the principal research scientist at the ICIPE's African Reference Laboratory for Bee Health. He calls the quality a "novel resistance mechanism," and his team is selectively breeding bees that exhibit this quality to create a strong base of bees in Africa.  In the center's lab in Nairobi, a scientist collects the semen from male drone bees, squeezing their thoraxes and killing them in the process. Twelve male drone bees will die to artificially inseminate one queen bee. She puts the queen in a plastic tube, attached to carbon dioxide gas. The gas sends the queen to sleep, temporarily paralyzing her. Once the bee is asleep, the scientist opens up the bee's vaginal canal and drops the semen into it. The bees that will come from this queen will be less hostile to humans than this typical strain of African bee, and more productive and more resistant to disease.  While Africa has been spared by the mass bee losses occurring in the United States and Europe, with less advanced food security systems, Africa's scientists say they need to act proactively. "Bees are dying and countries are having shortages of pollinators, even in the United States," Raina said. "We thought, suppose if that disease occurred in Africa. What will happen to the food security system here?"  Around 70% of what the world consumes is dependent on bees for pollination. But with a population that is predicted to double by 2050, African farmers will have to provide for a larger -- and wealthier population. Scientists have no intention of bringing African bees to the struggling bee populations in the United States or Europe. "You don't want to cross one variety with another one and it will cause a disaster," Raina said. Still, studies from the laboratory may give some answers to some of the world's declining bee populations. Scientists are working on a bio pesticide made of a locally sourced plant extract that may help combat the Varroa mite, a parasite that contributes to death of bees in the United States. And while the research is still out, the signs are positive. </corpo>

        <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Shiny rings, white gowns and luxury cars filled the mammoth national convention center, next to the Chinese capital's Olympic Bird's Nest stadium, one recent weekend. Armed with balloons, teddy bears and goody bags filled with coupons, throngs of salespeople stood outside their booths, shoving free gifts into the hands of visitors in an attempt to turn them into clients. Spread across two floors, more than 200 vendors competed at Beijing's Olympic-sized wedding expo for the attention -- and, more importantly, the wallets -- of thousands of young couples. PHOTOS: Tibetan couple's unconventional wedding pictures go viral  Everything was on sale at a discount, but even a rough calculation on site pointed to the soaring cost of getting married in China. The total bill could easily exceed $20,000 -- an unimaginable sum just a few years ago -- counting a pair of rings, a bridal gown, a banquet, a photo shoot and a professional planner. In the United States, the average cost of a wedding -- excluding a honeymoon -- has a similar price tag of $25,200, according to the latest figure released by the Wedding Report, a market research firm. Although rapid economic growth has brought rising incomes, the average Chinese still makes only a fraction of their American counterpart. Government statistics show the annual disposable income for 2014 was only $3,283 per person in China. The ballooning cost of weddings has spurred a multi-billion-dollar industry, but also put a heavy burden on the more than 10 million couples marrying every year in the world's most populous nation, especially those who already feel financially strained trying to buy their first home and car. READ: How to get ahead on China's dating scene Faced with a deep-rooted cultural preference for marriage, however, young Chinese preparing to tie the knot admit that cutting back is not always an option. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime event -- so I have to show my commitment to her and her parents through the wedding," explained Wang Di, 23, who was looking for good deals at the expo even though he and his girlfriend don't plan to walk down the aisle for another two years. "We may not care that much about the ceremony -- but the parents and other relatives do."  Frustrated with family pressure, some rebellious Chinese couples have chosen to enter so-called "naked marriages" with no houses, no cars, no weddings -- and sometimes no rings. While the public seems to appreciate the philosophy of true love trumping everything else, most respondents in repeated surveys still reject the notion of disavowing all traditional trappings of marriage. Increasingly, though, less radical -- but more creative and affordable -- ideas are gaining popularity in big cities. At a courtyard house in suburban Beijing one recent Saturday, the dress code was casual, but everyone appeared to be having some serious fun at the bride and groom's "do-it-yourself" wedding. On stage, the bride had already kicked off her high-heels. The venue was the couple's home -- rented for only $2,500 a year from a local farmer. The decoration that emphasized fresh flowers and entertainment -- featuring a DJ and a band -- were both courtesy of their artistic friends. Adorning the brick walls were various home-made movie-style posters starring the bride and groom, including one showing them laughing in bed with the phrase "mad love" in bold yellow lettering splashed across the red duvet covering their bodies. READ: Glut of women at Shanghai's marriage market  "Almost every wedding now goes through the same drill and I don't want that," said bride Zhang Yueyue, a marketing manager at an arts magazine. "I think letting everyone have fun is the most important thing. Many Chinese weddings now are more about flaunting wealth and letting parents have 'face' through extravagance." Counting catering and tailor-made traditional Chinese dresses, Zhang and her artist husband spent less than $2,000 on their big day. With their modest incomes, the newlyweds agreed that saving from the wedding meant more money to start their married life together. Amid loud cheers and applause in the courtyard, some of the couple's guests already felt inspired. "My budget won't be high either," said Zhao Mengsha, a colleague and friend of the bride who is planning her own summer wedding. "I just want a big party with some entertainment -- and most importantly lots of alcohol." That definitely sounds like a winning formula for a special occasion.

        <corpo>(CNN)A U.S. woman's attempt to row solo from Japan to San Francisco was aborted just eight days into the journey due to bad weather. Sonya Baumstein, who has since returned to Japan safely, sent out a distress signal on Saturday about 155 miles off the coast of Japan. A freighter nearby picked her up before passing her on to a coast guard ship, the Japanese coast guard said. Baumstein set off from the port of Chosi, located east of Tokyo, on June 7 for the 6,000-mile journey, hoping to become the first woman to cross the Pacific alone. Baumstein's campaign manager, Andrew Cull, posted this statement on her website: "The past eight days have been interesting and we knew we were taking a chance with the weather and late season, concerned more about the weather upon arrival in California in the fall," wrote Cull. "After long conversations, loosing a drogue, a critical steering system failure, and battling headwinds and typhoons, Sonya made the decision to abandon this year's attempt. While we were only eight days in, the progress against wind and storms was slow and the next few weeks promised more storms and potentially even slower progress." The weather conditions also made it "impossible" for Baumstein to see other vessels near her, he wrote. Last Wednesday, Baumstein posted about her close run-in with a fishing boat. "All's well. After a hellacious first few days. Almost had a game ender with fish boat. Flare + Being prepared saved my life!" she texted via satellite. Baumstein has not made a decision on whether she will try again, her team said. </corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Um Haleema was just 16 years old when she was kidnapped. Her first few months in captivity, at the hands of militant group Boko Haram, were enough to break anyone's spirit -- let alone that of a teenage girl so far from home. She was captured trying to escape, along with three of her friends, as Boko Haram burned and ransacked her village. During her captivity, Um Haleema was forced to watch men, women and children slaughtered. She was forced into marriage. Forced to wait on a "husband" she hated. But while she watched, she says she was also waiting -- for a chance to break free. And after six long months, it finally came. "I had planned my escape from the beginning," she says. "There was a time my husband spent two weeks away, so I attempted to escape but guards returned me and beat me." Eventually, her captors' vigilance began to slip and she managed to escape. In her fear, all she remembers is walking for what felt like days until she finally reached safety. She arrived home to discover that her father had been killed by the same Boko Haram militants who had held her captive for almost a year. She also found she had become pregnant by her Boko Haram husband. Now, seven months along in her pregnancy, she has agreed to speak to CNN on the condition that we conceal her identity and change her name. She doesn't want to become the face of a growing crisis -- girls and women brutally victimized by Boko Haram. The fear, she says, is still with her. This time, though, it's the men in her own community she is scared of. "People in this village are rejecting me because of the pregnancy," she says. "Some will be happy to have me dead. Many people are even saying that I should go for an abortion." It's an option she refuses to contemplate, even though she says local men have let it be known they will not tolerate the children of Boko Haram living amongst them. She says they have threatened to kill both her and her baby. There are no exact figures, but aid agencies and government officials have told CNN that an alarming percentage of girls rescued from Boko Haram have returned pregnant. The UNFPA, which is working in camps for Nigeria's internally displaced, reports that 214 women in the camps are visibly pregnant, but it is still assessing how many got pregnant while being held by Boko Haram, and if there are still more in the earlier stages of pregnancy. "We do not know yet the total number of pregnant girls among those rescued," said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a report. "The screening is still ongoing." UNFPA said it is working to meet the medical, physical and psychological needs of the freed women. In recent months, Nigeria's military has raided several Boko Haram bases freeing captive women and children. In late April to early May, about 700 women and girls were rescued in separate operations. On hearing that her daughter had been abducted, Um Haleema's mother says she immediately feared the worst. "Anybody captured by Boko Haram is presumed dead," she explains. "They abducted my step-daughter&#8206; and my daughter. They took a total of seven girls from this house." She says she has heard of many mothers who felt that abortion was the only option they had, but insists it's not a risk she's willing to take with her daughter. "We heard about one girl who died after she attempted an abortion, losing both the mother and the baby," she says. "The girl was the only child to her mother, so that scared us. If God wishes, she will give birth safely. Life is in the hands of God alone." Boko Haram: A bloody insurgency, a growing challenge CNN spoke to the men Um Haleema accused of threatening her in her village. Part of a local vigilante group, they denied making the threats. The vigilante groups in the north of Nigeria -- men who take up arms to protect their communities from Boko Haram -- have long been used by the Nigerian government in an auxiliary capacity to fight against the militants. Their leader agreed to speak CNN. "I am not aware of any woman in this village who was impregnated by them," he said. "If any woman is found to be pregnant, in our tradition, the pregnancy is considered Haram (unlawful), hence we cannot accept them wholeheartedly because they can be like baby snakes." In Muslim communities, pregnancy outside of marriage is often seen as illegitimate, unless the mother can prove it was against her will. When the interview ended and the camera stopped rolling, the vigilante leader said that his group didn't believe Um Haleema had been forced into marriage and said that she and her unborn child will always be viewed with suspicion. But he refused to comment on what he and his men might do about it. Regardless of what others say, surviving both abduction and escape has made Um Haleema realize that she has the strength to see this through. Her child, she says, deserves to live.

        <corpo>London (CNN)Queen Elizabeth II marked her official birthday Saturday with a spectacular military parade and awards for actors, sportsmen and sportswomen, business leaders and community workers. The queen's actual birthday is on April 21 -- when the British monarch this year turned 89. But in line with tradition, her birthday is also celebrated on a summer Saturday when the weather is likely to be better for the parade, known as Trooping the Colour. The queen was joined by her husband, Prince Philip, and other members of the royal family for the ceremony in central London, led this year by the Welsh Guards. After the parade, the queen joined other members of the royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for a flypast by the Royal Air Force. At that point, Prince George, now a month from his second birthday, stole the show as he made his first balcony appearance in the arms of his father, Prince William. His mother, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, earlier made her first public appearance since the birth of Princess Charlotte on May 2, riding in a carriage with Prince Harry and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The queen's first Trooping the Colour was in 1953, shortly after her coronation. The queen also makes use of her official birthday to award honors to members of the public for their service to the nation. This year, recipients in the public eye include U.S. actor and director Kevin Spacey, recognized for his contribution over a decade as artistic director of the Old Vic theater in London; actor and charity fundraiser Lenny Henry; and Northern Irish musician Van Morrison. Another to be honored is journalist Caroline Criado-Perez, who in 2013 petitioned to have women displayed on British banknotes, prompting a storm of Twitter abuse. </corpo>

        <titulo>Who is the 2,000-year-old 'sleeping beauty'? - CNN.com</titulo>

        <autor>Daisy Carrington, for CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)It was the Queen of Sheba that first drew Louise Schofield -- an archaeologist and former curator at the British Museum -- to the Gheralta plateau in northern Ethiopia. She'd heard tell of a 20-foot stone stele carved with an inscription and a symbol often linked to the biblical queen: a sun and crescent moon. "The story of the Queen of Sheba has a central place in the heart of all Ethiopians, so I became interested in the story myself," she recalls (Sheba is thought to be located in parts of Ethiopia). It was this initial visit that ultimately led her to discover the 2,000-year-old remains of a character she fondly refers to as "sleeping beauty." The grave was discovered at the stone stele, in an area that was once part of the ancient kingdom of Aksum, which today encompasses Ethiopia and Eritrea. Inside, Schofield's team found the skeleton of a woman posed in a resting position, with her chin laid gently on one hand. A Roman-era bronze mirror was placed before her face. The corpse was surrounded with glass vessels (to catch the tears of the dead), as well as a bronze cosmetics spoon and a lump of kohl eyeliner. "She must have been very wealthy, and probably well-loved to be placed in this position, and judging by all the items of finery around her," surmised Schofield. The dig also uncovered several other graves, all of which had several bodies buried beneath. In some, she found the remains of large warriors clad who each wore an iron bangle. "We think they were warriors from a battle," she says. The unusual find suggests trade between Rome and Aksum started at least 200 years earlier than previously believed. As the dig is less than a month old, there's still a lot of information yet to come in about this restful lady. A bone expert wasn't able to ascertain her age at the time of death because the pelvis -- which usually provides a close approximation -- had been consumed by termites. Schofield hopes that analysis of the teeth will provide some answers. "There was something very personal about the way she was lying," Schofield says. The remains were also found surrounded by clay containers that likely contained food or drink (these have also been sent off for analysis). "The food, drink and cosmetics were all presumably left for her to use in the afterlife. She was pre-Christian and that's how people buried their dead then," says Schofield. Shofield has a bit of the Midas touch when it comes to extraordinary finds. She also recently uncovered a Roman-era perfume flask in the same cemetery, although by chance. The archaeologist is also the director of London-based NGO The Tigray Trust, and the item was first brought to her attention by a local farmer she knew through the organization. "I had been showing around a member of the Peace Corps who had been working in a nearby town (around the site), and we'd been out in the blazing sun for 8 hours, when a farmer I knew said his friend found something old, and he'd been keeping it for me," she recalls. "I was apologizing to the Peace Corps guy. I told him, 'it could be an old coffee pot, but you never know, it could be the Queen of Sheba's perfume flask.'"

        <corpo>The CNN Freedom Project wants to amplify the voices of the victims of modern-day slavery, highlight success stories and help unravel the tangle of criminal enterprises trading in human life. (CNN)What has education helped you achieve? That was the question the CNN Freedom Project posed to Twitter users in the run up to World Against Child Labor Day on June 12, which this year focuses on how education can help end the cycle of poverty and underage workers. The answers were as diverse as the respondents with your tweets showing just how much of an impact education has had on lives the world over. To highlight the importance of education, we asked you to share your old school photos. People from all walks of life got involved, telling the world how education helped them get to where they are now.  According to the International Labour Organization, 120 million children between the ages of five and 14 are involved in child labor, with some 98 million working in agriculture. For many of those children, going to school is impossible. Others have to fit their education around their work, making it harder to get skills they need to find decent jobs as adults. The result is that their own children in turn may need to work to support the family. Conversely, if children receive quality education up until legal employment age, they are much less likely to fall into poverty -- and if they are well employed as adults, they will not have to rely on their children to bring in additional income. That's why the CNN Freedom Project is highlighting the value of education. CNN anchors got involved with the initiative too, showing us how far they have come, thanks to a good education. "Education helped me to have lots of opportunities. My sports broadcast career began at university," said sports anchor and correspondent Alex Thomas. While CNN's Isa Soares said education helped her to "be insatiably curious, creative and critical."

        <titulo>Can Thai fishing industry tackle its slavery problem? - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-05-17T13:46:14Z</data>

        <corpo>Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has told CNN that slave labor in his country's fishing industry "is now severe" and that Thailand will act to tackle it. CNN investigates the scale of the problem in this special report. (CNN)The hours would be long and the work hard, but spending a year as a fisherman seemed like a good option to Samart Senasook. Previous jobs as a security guard in Bangkok had been sporadic, so when a man known as Vee promised the 40-year old decent wages on a fishing boat he decided to take the chance. Vee turned out to be a broker, a link in the chain of human trafficking that supplies the Thai fishing industry with thousands of migrant workers and turns many of them into virtual slaves. Instead of a year on board a Thai fishing vessel, Senasook said he spent six, and was made to work 20-hour days in life-threatening conditions. His unwanted odyssey only came to an end last month, thousands of miles from Thailand, on the eastern Indonesian island of Ambon. The boat he was on was impounded by Indonesian authorities for suspected illegal fishing, with Senasook and his crewmates held in custody.  Looking back on his ordeal, that he says lasted from January 2009 to March 2015, Senasook rarely saw land, as the boat he was on roamed further and further from Thai waters in search of increasingly scarce fish. Its catch was part of Thailand's multi-billion dollar seafood industry that feeds tens of millions in Europe and the United States. Senasook describes his life on board as one full of intimidation, sleep deprivation and regular beatings from the boat's captain. "(The captain) kicked and punched me," he said. "My nose and mouth were bleeding. I still have blood clotted in my teeth. My jaw hurts every time I chew." With no way to escape, he became suicidal. "I was thinking of my family, my mother. There were times, I was about to jump into the sea to kill myself. "My friend from the engine room held me back. Otherwise I would have been dead by now," he said. Senasook says the boat's captain kept his and the crew's ID at all times, essentially holding them captive. When Senasook did finally get his hands on his identity card on Ambon, he was horrified to see it was in a false name. He had gone from being captive on board a fishing boat to being stranded on a distant island. "There are many of my friends die in Indonesia. And their graves were with wrong names," said Senasook. "Like, if I died, at my grave it would not bear my name but it would be someone else." In desperation, he wrote an open letter to the Thai Prime Minister asking for help. That helped to release him from Indonesian custody, but, isolated and penniless, he could not make his way home to Thailand. He received a final payment of 1,750 baht ($53) from his ship's captain, but was then told he needed to pay 20,000 baht ($615) for the agent fee that brought him on the boat in 2009.  Eventually he received assistance from Thai-based Labor Rights Promotion Network (LPN) and was repatriated to Thailand last month. He was one of the more fortunate ones. The LPN discovered a similar situation on the nearby island of Benjina, where the group says hundreds of other fishermen from across Southeast Asia were trapped and living in desperate conditions. The rights group estimates there could be up to 3,000 trafficked victims working on boats in these seas. "(The fishermen on Ambon and Benjina) have forged or no documents so can't return home," said the LPN's Patima Tangpratyakoon. "The situation is severe." But the problem of modern day slaves fishing for seafood that ends up on dinner plates on the other side of the world goes much further than these tiny Indonesian islands. The extent of the situation is hard to gauge. Thai government figures state that there are 145,000 working in its fishing industry, with 80% of those migrant workers, mainly from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. However, activist group Raks Thai Foundation suggests there are in excess of 200,000 trafficked, unregistered workers. The exact number of fishing vessels is also unknown -- official figures put them at around 57,000 -- because registration is lax. The real number could be double that.  The issue of slavery and rights abuses in the Thai fishing industry has become acute in recent years. As the global demand for seafood has increased, the Thai economy improved, so attracting workers to dangerous jobs on fishing boats has become more difficult. Last year the U.S. State Department downgraded Thailand to the lowest tier on its Trafficking in Persons Report 2014, which can result in the withdrawal of international aid. Last month the European Union called Thailand a "non-cooperating" country because of poor monitoring and control of its fishing vessels and the trade of fish and seafood from other countries into Thailand. Unless it cracks down on the situation, Thailand faces a financially damaging embargo on its fish exports to the EU from October. In response, Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has declared combating human trafficking a national priority. In a statement in March, he called on all government agencies to "clean up their houses." Traffickers and government officials that have colluded with them "no longer have any room to exist in Thai society," he said. According to Thailand's Department of Fisheries, new control measures are being implemented. As well as inspections of fishing vessels, boats more than 30 tons in size that travel outside of Thai waters will have to be equipped with an electronic vessel monitoring system (VMS). Without it, the boats will not be given a fishing license. However, only around 6,000 boats in the Thai fishing fleet are of this size, according to the Marine Department. Another new government initiative that came into play in April requires each fishing vessel to list who is on board, who it is licensed to, the name of its owner, and where it will operate before it leaves port and once it returns. These "port-out, port-in" measures "will help enable us to reduce the risk of human trafficking, reduce the risk of force labor," said Warapon Prompol, deputy director-general, Department of Fisheries. Crew manifests were not previously required. "For the Marine Department we can check only a certain type of vessel, a certain size, too. But now the government is trying to reduce the size (of the vessel) that allows that we can check them," said Chula Sukmanop, director-general to the Marine Department. He added that enforcement is made more difficult because all too often ships will change crew once they leave port.  While laws against human trafficking exist in the country -- a new Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act was approved as recently as March -- it has often been this lack of enforcement that has allowed exploitation of fishermen to continue. "There have been laws that should penalize employers with penalties and not just the migrants themselves, but they've been rarely enforced in the past," said Max Tunon, senior program manager for the International Labour Organization, who specializes in migrant workers' rights in Southeast Asia. "This is the most attention there's been on the issue, coming from the highest level," he added. "There's a greater acknowledgment that corruption exists and that increasing regulation (of the industry) needs to be linked to the broader issues of migration." Exports by Thai seafood companies to the United States and Europe are worth around $2.5 billion annually, with Thai Union Frozen Products (TUF) one of the largest -- and owner of the John West and Chicken of the Sea brands. In a statement in March, Khun Thiraphong Chansiri, TUF's president and CEO, called human trafficking in its supply chain "utterly unacceptable," but said "we all have to admit that it is difficult to ensure the Thai seafood industry's supply chain is 100% clean." Progress to combat the problems of trafficked workers and slave labor has been made thanks to market and trade pressure, said Tunon. But it's still hard to see real change on the ground. "It's been a challenge for years and it will be hard to measure progress because there has not been much of a baseline from which to gather credible information on the problem," said Tunon. "The attention is now on the fishing industry, as it's particularly vulnerable, but this could help better protection for migrant workers in sections that don't have consumer or trade pressure, that aren't so visible because they don't feed into the global supply chain." </corpo>

        <titulo>Slavery to doubt: An Eritrean migrant's story - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-05-15T16:18:10Z</data>
        <autor>Ben Wedeman, CNN International correspondent</autor>
        <corpo>Rome (CNN)"What are you doing here?" A man in a red t-shirt and a long black ponytail shouted angrily at us as we conducted interviews at a center for migrants -- most of whom were from Eritrea -- in the Rome suburb of Tiburtina. "You should be in Eritrea interviewing that demon there!" That "demon," the man went on to explain, is Isaias Afwerki, the country's president since 1993. The man told us he was from Eritrea and had been in Italy for eight years, but declined to be interviewed, fearing his relatives back home would be punished. Eritreans make up the second largest group of migrants, after Syrians, reaching the shores of Europe.  But unlike the Syrians, the Eritreans aren't fleeing war. Instead they are refugees from what human rights activists describe as a system of official slavery&#8212;open-ended military service for all males and unmarried females between the ages of 18 and 50. Benjamin, 23, comes from Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. When we met him in a park in Ponte Mammolo in northern Rome, he had been in Italy for about eight days. "I ran away from Eritrea because I don't want to serve in the military," he told me. "I was hiding from place-to-place for a very long time. My family suffered too much trying to hide me. I had to move out. My destiny was to be in the military and that's not what I want. The only opportunity I have is running away." Benjamin spoke almost flawless English, which he taught himself while on the run. When we interviewed him, he asked that we not show his face. He was one of the few in the park who were willing to be interviewed at all. The day before Italian police had come in the morning with bulldozers and demolished a small shanty town of plywood and corrugated iron shacks that had housed around 200 migrants. Benjamin's "house" as he calls it, is a strip of cardboard he sleeps on under a tree. His story is similar to many we've heard from other migrants.  His family scraped together as much money as they could to pay what he described as "facilitators" to help him escape from Eritrea and travel across Ethiopia and Sudan to Libya, where he ended up in the town of Ajdabia. In Ajdabia, a town I spent lots of time in during the Libyan uprising in 2011, he stayed for a month in a house run by several facilitators, ironically, fellow Eritreans. The bonds of nationality didn't count for much. "He was a very terrible person," recalled Benjamin. "The only thing he wanted from us was money. He didn't feed us properly. To be honest I didn't take a shower for the full month I was in that house. You were allowed to go to the bathroom only one time a day." The facilitators "took our phones, they took everything we had in our pockets. I had &#8364;200. They took my wallet and my documents. All I had was the clothing I was wearing." Summing up the experience in Ajdabia, he said "it was the example of hell." From Ajdabia he and other Eritrean migrants were moved to the Libyan capital, Tripoli. There they were crammed with around 600 others onto a two-level fishing boat. "The engine burned out two or three times and the fan belt also broke. We stayed in the middle of nowhere for seven hours," he told me. "Everybody gave up on that boat," he said. "We were just praying to God to help us. Some people were fighting there. Some people were sitting inside the engine room. Many were unconscious. It was too hot, and people were vomiting." Benjamin was in a cramped, suffocating room on the lower deck. "I was vomiting from the time I got onto the boat. It was so crowded, but I sat on top of my friend and had my face in a little window where I could breathe. I don't remember what happened after that. I was just feeling my pain." After around 13 hours at sea, he heard a helicopter overhead. Someone shut off the engine, and they waited until rubber dinghies from the Italian Navy came to their rescue.  The Navy took them first to a receiving center on the island of Lampedusa, and then they were moved to another center in Sicily. "After we reach Sicily, they start forcing the people to be fingerprinted so we decided to run away," he said. According to European Union regulations, migrants must be registered in the country they arrive in, and cannot go on to request asylum elsewhere. To avoid being registered, he and his friends left the center, saying they were going to a nearby church. "And once we went outside we never went back," he said. With help from friends, who gave him &#8364;50, he said he was able to get to Rome, with &#8364;7 left over. In Ponte Mammalo, local churches provided him and other migrants with food and clothing. Benjamin's goal is eventually get to Germany, where he hopes to get an education and a "better life." He has no relatives there, speaks no German, but clings to the vague hope that somehow he will land on his feet. "It's just me," he says with a smile. </corpo>

        <titulo>Chinese feminists show off armpit hair in photo contest - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-10T15:01:44Z</data>
        <autor>Wilfred Chan and Shen Lu, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Beijing (CNN)In the fight against domestic violence and gender inequality, Chinese feminists have opened up a new battlefront: Their armpits. They ask, why should women have to shave their pits when men are never expected to? To subvert the double standard, feminist Xiao Meili, 25, started an armpit hair photo contest on Chinese social network Weibo. Dozens of women have participated, including three of the five feminists briefly arrested in March over a protest for gender equality. The participants sent in selfies and glamor shots with their arms proudly raised, revealing natural hair underneath. "Women should have the right to decide how to deal with their bodies, including small details like armpit hair," Xiao tells CNN. "You can choose to shave it, but you shouldn't be forced to do so under the pressure of stereotypes." Six winners will be selected from the photo competition, which ends Wednesday. Prizes include condoms, vibrators and a pedestal urinal that a woman can use while standing.  Xiao, who became a feminist in college after reading female authors like Simone de Beauvoir, says the aesthetics of silky smooth armpits didn't become popular in China until around 20 years ago, as American influences swept into the country. Before that, nobody thought showing armpit hair was an issue. As a small child, Xiao recalled her mother's indifference over armpit hair. "She said, 'I don't have much of it. Plus it will eventually shed years later. Why would I bother removing it?'" These days, shaving has become the norm for China women -- but it's not right, says Xiao. "The media coverage on female celebrities' underarms is disgusting, as if women shouldn't have hair or it's something to be ashamed of, while male celebrities openly show off their armpit hair." As one participant says beneath her photo submission: "I love my armpit hair. It's part of my body. I hope girls can show off their armpit hair without fear."  To Xiao, concern over the armpit hair issue isn't trivial -- it's a matter of principle. "Some people question why I make a fuss about the hair. They say there are more important issues that need to be solved like domestic violence and sexual assault. I think they are equally important. They're all about fighting for gender equality." Xiao has tackled other issues concerning women. Last year, she walked more than 1,200 miles across China, sending letters to officials in each city she visited to raise awareness of sex abuse in Chinese schools. Before that, she has staged public art performances to protest everything from violence against women to unfair ratios of male-to-female public restrooms. But it hasn't been easy. In March, five of her friends, fellow activists, were detained after planning a protest in Beijing to counter sexual harassment on public transportation. They were only released a month later after news had spread around the world, leading even Hillary Clinton to condemn the arrests.  Although China's current regime was founded on values of gender equality -- Mao Zedong banned old practices such as the binding of women's feet, and famously declared "In China, women hold up half the sky," -- women in today's China face violence and discrimination. According to a 2013 U.N. report, over half of men surveyed in China said they had committed an act of violence against a woman, and over one-fifth confessed to raping a woman. At the same time, women face extreme pressure to marry early, or else risk becoming a "leftover woman." Women who remain single, or fall outside beauty standards, are mocked as "manly women" -- sometimes on national television. And women remain underrepresented in leadership fields: No woman has ever reached China's Standing Committee, the country's highest-ranking political body. No matter: Xiao says she is determined to see the fight through. "Gender discrimination exists wherever there are people," she says. "Something needs to be done. We want our voices heard." </corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Four foreign hikers who posed naked on Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia were freed Friday after they were fined and sentenced to time served. The backpackers -- from Britain, Canada and the Netherlands -- were arrested after stripping naked May 30 and posing for photos on the mountaintop, the nation's Bernama news agency reported. The mountain is considered sacred in Malaysia. They had pleaded guilty to "committing an obscene act." CNN has verified the identity of the two Canadians as Lindsey and Danielle Peterson. The Briton is named Eleanor Hawkins. The name of the Dutchman has not yet been confirmed by CNN.  The court in Kota Kinabalu on Friday evening fined the four 5,000 Malaysian ringgits, about $1,332, each and sentenced them to three days in prison. Taking into account the time served already, the court ordered them freed. Local residents had said their behavior caused the Kota Kinabalu earthquake this month, which killed 16 people. The indigenous people of Sabah believe the tourists disrespected local culture and angered the spirit of the mountain, Bernama reported. Among those who appeared in court was a British citizen who was arrested at the airport this week as she was about to leave for the capital of Kuala Lumpur. The other three turned themselves in. They could have faced three months in prison.  It is not the first time tourists have made headlines for stripping off their clothes at major attractions. Cambodia deported two U.S. tourists for allegedly taking nude pictures at Angkor Archaeological Park after a string of nudity-related incidents hit the religious sites this year. At least eight tourists were detained last year in separate incidents for getting naked and posing for photos in Machu Picchu, the 15th-century attraction in Peru.

        <titulo>Fame poses new risk for China's 'magic rabbit' - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Rarer than a panda, few people knew about the Ili pika until earlier this year when pictures of China's "magic bunny" went viral after being featured in a series of news reports. But now the tiny and endangered mammal is finding out the price of fame. Conservationist Li Weidong, who discovered the species in 1983, lamented the lack of funding for his conservation efforts when first interviewed by CNN in March. READ: Meet China's 'magic rabbit' He's since been able to raise almost $28,000 on a Chinese crowd-funding website, enough to fund his research and conservation efforts for the next year. But Li told CNN this week that the tiny mammal now faces other threats. People have tried to catch the pika, wanting one as a pet. Companies have offered Li funding to catch the pika and then artificially breed them, Li said. "Ili pikas, as alpine animals, can't adapt to the environment at low elevations without special facilities," he said. "Would they survive? Their population is already small enough. Human capture will accelerate the extinction." Fearing that cameras might disturb pikas, Li said he has also turned away a dozen more photographers who hoped accompany him on his field research in the Tianshan mountains.  Native to the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, there are fewer than 1,000 of these creatures living in the Tianshan mountain range in the region, Li said. Li discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, and named it after his hometown, Ili. A year ago, Li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery. In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Li. For years, Li has called for Ili Pika to be listed on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law. The appeal seems more urgent now as more people have laid eyes on the it, Li said. Li said he is in negotiation with authorities in Jinghe County, where many Ili Pikas were discovered, for the establishment of a nature reserve to keep people away from the rare animals.  In late May, Li led a team of five volunteers to collect video footage from infrared cameras set up last August. Some 30 infrared cameras captured about 16 video clips of the Pika from the two areas over the past 10 months. Li said the video clips showed that pikas communicate with each other through their own urine traces and bodily waste. "They can tell by sniffing whether another pika is nearby. If it is a member of the opposite sex, they find a mate. If it is within its own gender, they claim territory." However, Li didn't find any pikas in the two sites where he spotted and photographed the elusive creature in July last year. He said this doesn't mean there are fewer pikas now as footage from one more area is yet to be collected and the cameras only covered half of the census areas. Yet it still worries him, he said. "We don't know whether it's because the animals didn't come out during the winter, or they were eaten by natural enemies or they died." To collect more accurate and complete information, Li said he plans to buy more infrared cameras with the recently raised money and set them up in all six areas. </corpo>

        <titulo>Iraqi who has seen it all: ISIS in Mosul to stay - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-10T12:25:21Z</data>

        <corpo>Baghdad (CNN)We had just finished up our shoot in Al-Makasib Girls' Elementary School in Baghdad's Saadoun neighbourhood and were loading the gear into the car when a man sitting in a wheelchair across the courtyard beckoned to me. "Come, talk to me, too," he said. He introduced himself as Louay Hikmat Shawkat, Iraqi Army veteran of the war with Iran and then the 1991 Kuwait war, refugee from Mosul and a self-described translator of English, French, "Canadian" and "Yugoslavian." Given that the latter two aren't languages, and his English was a tad scratchy, I was intrigued. We were visiting the school to talk to its current "residents" -- 48 Christian families who had fled Mosul when ISIS took over a year ago. Mosul, in northern Iraq and one of the nation's largest cities, is about 405 kilometers (about 250 miles) from the capital of Baghdad. But for these internal refugees, it might as well be a world away. I asked Louay, who is 60, when he thought he might be able to return home.  "Take it out of your mind that ISIS is going to leave Mosul," he insisted, gesturing with his hand as if he were pulling a thread out of his head. The chances he and his wife will someday return to their home in the Mosul suburb of Hamdaniya, he said, are "one in a hundred. One in a million!" Louay said he suffers from diabetes, but he insists on lighting up another cigarette in his nicotine-stained fingers "because I get upset whenever I speak about "Da'ish", the Arabic acronym for ISIS. ISIS, he said, "is an illness. It's impossible to cure. Cancer can be cured, tuberculosis can be cured. Almost every illness can be cured, but not this one." His diabetes causes him to suffer from dizziness whenever he stands up. "If I were well," he vows, "I would go fight them myself." Like everyone else I spoke with at the school, he is desperate to leave Iraq, but his attempts to apply for asylum have come to naught. His last hope, he told me with a mischievous grin, is an old Canadian girlfriend in Montreal.  In the school's makeshift kitchen, I met Linda Jannan, who was busy with the washing up. She fled Mosul with her husband and three children in August, first going to Dohuk, in Iraqi Kurdistan, where they spent six months in a tent in a refugee camp. A thin women in her 30s with the dark circles under her eyes, she also was desperate to leave Iraq. "We are finished," she told me. "Our future, our children, our men have been destroyed. We're too afraid to go out and find work. If only someone outside Iraq will help us find a solution, let us emigrate. We have no hope left." She and her husband had applied to asylum in the United States and Germany, but they were rejected because they have no close relatives in either country. Obama: No 'complete strategy' yet on training Iraqis Over the past few months, these refugees have been visited by a variety of reporters. And it's clear their patience is wearing thin. "What's the point of all this talk?" one man asked me, after declining my request for an on-camera interview. "We talk, we talk, and nothing happens," he snapped. Firyal Abdel Kareem, who was sharing the kitchen with Linda Jannan, is at her wits' end. She spent the winter months in a windy tent in Zakho, near the Turkish border, and is now suffering from Baghdad's sweltering summer heat. "Find a solution for us," she told me, "it's enough. We are tired." "Either they take us out of here, or send us home. Do we have to stay in this school, or in a tent?"  I've been covering Iraq since 1994. I covered the impact of the draconian international sanctions imposed on the country after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. I covered the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and the messy, bloody aftermath. And now I'm back covering the war against ISIS. I'm lucky. I come and go as I please. For the people in this school, there is no such luxury. Thair Al-Naim, his wife and their three young sons left behind a relatively comfortable life in Mosul last summer. He's now penniless and out of work, all his construction equipment seized and sold by ISIS. Speaking to him in the classroom they now call "home," I sense a deep weariness with a life that, for too long, has been fraught with violence and fear. "Since the fall of Saddam," he sighs, "all we've had is war after war, and now we have Da'ish." CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>Chinese astronaut: We want more cooperation - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-05-29T03:21:08Z</data>
        <autor>David McKenzie, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>"Inside Space City," a world exclusive CNN interview with three of China's top astronauts, premieres on Friday May 29 at 11:30 pm ET Beijing (CNN)China wants greater cooperation with other nations in space, particularly the United States, the country's most experienced astronaut has told CNN in an exclusive interview. Fifteen nations including the United States, Russia and Japan cooperate on International Space Station missions, but China's involvement has always been a non-starter because of longstanding resistance from U.S. legislators. INTERACTIVE: IS CHINA WINNING THE SPACE RACE? "As an astronaut, I have a strong desire to fly with astronauts from other countries. I also look forward to going to the International Space Station," Commander Nie Haisheng told CNN. "...Space is a family affair, many countries are developing their space programs and China, as a big country, should make our own contributions in this field." The comments came during a wide-ranging and exclusive interview with the three-person crew of the Shenzhou-10 mission inside Space City, the center of China's space program, near Beijing last month. In 2011, Congress passed an act to bar NASA from having any bilateral contact with individuals of the Chinese space program because of national security fears. "Every time it gets mentioned at all anywhere near Congress, it gets shut down immediately," space analyst Miles O'Brien told CNN. "There is tremendous skepticism there about China. It is viewed as a foe, it is viewed as a government that seeks to take our intellectual property -- our national secrets and treasure." In a white paper released Tuesday, China said that outer space had become an area of "strategic competition." "The Chinese government has always advocated the peaceful use of outer space, it opposes space weaponization and an arms race in outer space. This position will not be changed," Wang Jin, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, said. MORE: NASA astronaut: We risk losing out to China  A recent report for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said China's improving space capabilities had "negative sum consequences for U.S. military security." But Nie discounted those fears. "The United States and Russia started their space programs early. They are the pioneers," he said. He says foreign astronauts are welcome to visit China's own space station once it is launched. The Chinese expect to finish their space station by 2022 -- around the time International Space Station runs out of funding, potentially leaving China as the only country with a permanent presence in space. China launched its manned space program in 1992. It initially borrowed and bought a great deal of Russian technology, primarily by replicating their Soyuz space craft -- which they dubbed the Shenzhou. But it has been steadily checking off the boxes in manned space flight. In 2003, it put its first man in space. In 2008, it completed its first space walk. And in 2013 Nie and his crew completed the country's longest space mission to date and twice docked with the Tiangong-1 space lab. MORE: Meet the crew of the Shenzhou-10  With support from the highest echelons of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and exceptionally deep pockets, most analysts believe China's space program could become a world leader. "I think in the end -- tortoise versus hare style, they will probably win," said O'Brien. In October last year, China launched its most ambitious unmanned space mission to date: to orbit the moon and then return to Earth. Nicknamed "Xiaofei," or "Little Flyer" on Chinese social networks, the unmanned orbiter traversed 840,000 kilometers on its eight-day mission that saw it round the far side of the moon and take some incredible pictures of Earth and the moon together, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. It then successfully re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and parachuted down to the surface in Inner Mongolia. Wu Yanhua, vice director of China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, said at the time the successful test mission has gathered a lot of experimental data and laid "a solid foundation for future missions." While China hasn't committed to it, many analysts think it wants to put a man on the moon. However, when asked, Commander Nie won't be drawn on whether this is the ultimate goal of the country's space program. "For the next step, the focus is Tiangong-2 and then we will do more preparatory work for the space station." </corpo>

        <titulo>YSL ad with 'unhealthily' thin model banned in UK - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-03T14:14:04Z</data>
        <autor>Mairi Mackay, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>London (CNN)The UK's advertising watchdog has banned an ad for fashion brand Yves Saint Laurent featuring a model who it said was "unhealthily underweight." The Advertising Standards Authority ruled the black-and-white image of a model in a short, black dress and platform high heels was "irresponsible." The ad appeared in Elle UK magazine. The model's pose and the lighting effect drew attention to her rib cage, which was "visible and appeared prominent," the ruling found. The ad also focused on her legs, adding that "her thighs and knees appeared a similar width, and ... looked very thin," especially the "contrast between the narrowness of her legs and her platform shoes," according to the ruling. The ad is the latest in a long line of controversies surrounding the fashion industry's use of thin models, among them the death from anorexia of French model Isabelle Caro following a shocking ad campaign and bans on ultra-skinny models in Israel and France. The UK agency looked into the ad following a complaint from an Elle UK reader. In response to the ruling, Yves Saint Laurent SAS indicated it didn't agree with the view that the model was unhealthily thin "but did not provide a detailed response," the agency said. Both Elle UK magazine and Yves Saint Laurent declined to comment on the ban when CNN reached out to them. A representative from Beat, a UK charity that supports those affected by eating disorders said: "The constant portrayal of a very slender look as the only aspirational ideal for young people needs to be challenged if a generation (is) to grow up with a robust sense of their self-worth." "The ASA ruling is not about whether this person in the picture is healthy, but whether the images of her are being used in a way that can have an irresponsible effect on others, and we are really pleased to see that they are taking action to uphold their responsibility for the social impact of adverts," the rep added. The Advertising Standards Authority said that the ad must not appear again in its current form and called on advertisers to ensure images in their ads were created responsibly. </corpo>

        <titulo>Architect designs giant 3D-printed estate - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-03T11:47:58Z</data>
        <autor>Eoghan Macguire, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)There's already a 3D-printed house being built in the Netherlands. In China, 3D-printed mansions are reportedly on the rise. Now, a 3D printed estate featuring a swimming pool, jacuzzi, car port and 2,400 square foot house could be coming to a sleepy plot of land in upstate New York. The ambitious project is being undertaken by New York City architect Adam Kushner, alongside partners including 3D-printing pioneer Enrico Dini and his D-Shape firm. Kushner told CNN that surveying has already begun with excavation work also set to commence soon. The swimming pool and jacuzzi are penciled in to be completed by December 2015 while construction of the house is expected to continue until the end of 2017, he says. But the project hinges on getting the giant 3D printer, which will be used to produce the digitally designed building blocks of the estate on-site, into the country. The device is currently in Italy after it was originally being built for a project partly funded by the Italian defense agencies. Military clearance is now required before the green light is given to export the printer to the United States, Dini says. The delay in receiving this clearance is part of the reason the project has been held up since it was first announced back in August 2014. "We are now waiting (for) permission to borrow the printer (from the military)," Dini says. "If I had another printer I'd send it there tomorrow, but unfortunately we don't have and must wait."  Whatever the import-export issues, Kushner says he sees the estate project as a test of D-Shape's printer technology and its distinctive method. This practice entails collecting sand, dust and gravel on site and mixing them with a magnesium-based binding agent to produce the 3D-printed building blocks required to piece the estate together. According to literature on the D-Shape website, the material produced by the printer is "similar to marble" in its constitution. This technique is vastly different from other 3D-printing methods, Kushner says, and enables the production of many more "sculptural forms" that simply aren't possible with other systems. If D-Shape can prove its technology works and is efficient for a project of this size, Kushner believes it could lead to all manner of possibilities in architecture and construction. Not only could it be faster and safer than existing construction methods, he says, it could also end up being cheaper, more streamlined and of higher quality. And although the 3D-printed estate is something only the very wealthiest would be able to replicate, Kushner sees D-Shape's construction methods benefiting the less fortunate as well. "This will serve as a way of using our project to ... pave the way for more humanitarian purposes that we see as the highest and best use for our technology," he says. "If we can build a simple pool house, I can print thousands of refugee housings. If I can build a pool, I can print underwater reefs (which he says D-Shape has already done before) to repair bridges, piers and infrastructures."  Integrating progressively more advanced 3D-printing methods into the construction industry has been a topic that has generated many eye-catching headlines in recent years. The process of contour crafting -- where large 3D printers are assembled on a building site (much like what will happen on Kushner's estate) and programmed to construct pre-designed concrete structures and their relevant sub-components -- was put forward by Dr. Behrokh Khoshnevis of the University of Southern California as far back as 2009. Khoshnevis told industry website 3DPrint.com earlier this year that the first printers large enough for his version of contour crafting should become available within the next two years. He added that the method could even be used to build high-rise structures within ten years. Chinese firm WinSun seemed to take inspiration from Khoshnevis' methods when they claimed to have 3D printed a mansion and six-story tower block in the city of Suzhou, eastern China earlier this year. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, DUS Architects continue to piece together a 3D-printed house using its "KamerMaker" machine. Company co-founder Katherine De Wit described the DUS technique as being a potentially valuable tool that could be added to those already used to build homes. Other experts, however are more cautious about the immediate potential of 3D-printing technology in the construction industry. In an interview with CNN in 2014, Dr. Phil Reeves, managing director of UK-based 3D-printing consultancy and research firm Econolyst, described 3D-printing a house on site like that planned by DUS as counter to existing building techniques which are already relatively efficient. Then there are other fast-developing building methods like prefabricated construction which entails manufacturing components in a factory before transporting and rapidly piecing them together on a building site. Chinese firm Broad Sustainable Building claimed to have used this method to piece together a 57-story skyscraper in just 19 days earlier this year. For Kushner, however, the benefits of large-scale 3D-printing are many and will likely increase as the technology becomes more advanced. "This is not superfluous, nor a lazy architects idyll," he says. "I think it's as important as the automobile was in changing the design of cities or how the printing press altered communication." "Why? Because it democratizes construction and architecture and puts it into everyone's hands, just like the camera phone made everyone a photographer. Not everyone is good at it but everyone can become one." Read: Dutch firm build 'world's first 3D-printed house Read: Life inside the densest place on earth </corpo>

        <corpo>Lampedusa, Italy (CNN)The Italian Navy approached the rickety wooden ship with caution, and a wide berth. Go in too quickly, and the people onboard become so excited about their impending rescue that they capsize by all moving to one side. This is how so many of the drowning disasters have happened. As European leaders decide on measures to tackle the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean, the race to save lives on the high seas goes on, as our CNN team witnessed firsthand. We started our day on a helicopter bound for the frigate Virginio Fasan, one of the Italian Navy's most modern warships, currently in international waters facing the Libyan coast. Along with four other Italian naval vessels they patrol an area of sea about the size of the United Kingdom; some 80,000 square miles. It's a huge effort for the 1,000 men and women continuously at sea, because each rescue takes several hours. Barely 30 minutes into our chopper flight journey the pilot tells us they have spotted a boat, possibly full of migrants. And onboard screens beaming imagery of a wooden vessel packed to the gills confirms their suspicions. The blue boat is on course for Lampedusa, they've completed almost half the journey from Libya 85 miles from where we are... now in international waters the smugglers use their cell phones to call the Italian coast guard for help! That's their MO. The warship Sfinge (Sphinx) is closest, and is promptly dispatched to rescue those onboard. Crew on smaller boats hand out the distinctive orange life vests as soon as they arrive. To get closer and at sea level&#8212;we fly back to the Fasan and get into the ship's speed boat, and watch as navy teams move people to the warship in small groups. All personnel involved in the operation are dressed head to toe in white biohazard suits, face masks and gloves, in case of infectious disease. We're told that in all the crossings not a single case of Ebola has been brought over. The boat has been checked for hostile intent, and once the navy is satisfied they are all migrants, they begin the slow process of off-loading these people and transferring them by their two small boats to the warship. One by one they bring each person up the stairs&#8212;give them a medical, hand out bottles of water, and sit them in rows on the top deck, under the broiling sun. Men are separated from the women and children. One person died, suffocated during the overcrowded boat ride from Libya. Three people had to be medevaced off&#8212;but in all this mission saved 289 lives. They are among 900 who were saved on Wednesday in three different wooden boats, because it was sunny and calm. Most of the migrants saved on this day are from Ethiopia, Sudan, and Eritrea in East Africa, escaping a dictatorial regime and military service that they say amounts to slavery. Almost nobody on board speaks English, but one man tells us his story, saying he left his wife and children over a year ago, and hopes his arrival in Europe will mean he can afford a better life for them back home. And even though he knows a lot of people have died trying to make this dangerous crossing, he tells he was not afraid. "We have one chance, to live or to die," he says. We also talk to 25-year-old Juri, who tells us that God answered their prayers in the form of the Italian Navy. "God is good," she says with a big smile on her face, "they save our lives." UPDATE: On Friday, UNHCR reported that 180 of those rescued had been transferred to four facilities in eastern Sicily. The rest, they say, are still at the port and will be transferred soon. The one fatality was a 17-year-old Eritrean man, who reportedly died of asphyxiation in the hull of the boat. CNN's Mick Krever contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Iraq roils in a maelstrom: ISIS now controls Ramadi, a new prime minister is in charge, Shiite-Sunni bloodshed flows, and a U.S.-led coalition is back, this time executing airstrikes in Iraq. The saga of Iraq is, as an analyst put it, "a rather straightforward but sad story" since the U.S. military left the country at the end of 2011, only to find itself returning in a smaller way. The fall of Ramadi to ISIS this week strikes many as a milestone because the city is the capital of Iraq's biggest province and because U.S. troops heroically fought insurgents there in the mid-2000s. Some politicians feel the U.S. withdrawal of troops was a mistake, though public opinion favored it then. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Too late for that now," said Paul Salem of the nonpartisan Middle East Institute. See Interactive Timeline on ISIS's Rise Iraq's problems are bigger than Ramadi: its second largest city, Mosul, is now ISIS' capital, and Iraq still struggles with self-governance, politically and militarily. Here are events since late 2011 that help explain Iraq's ongoing conflict:  December 31, 2011 After almost 4,500 Americans were killed and more than 30,000 injured since 2003 when the United States invaded Iraq, President Barack Obama orders the withdrawal of all troops. The President welcomes them home. "The war in Iraq will soon belong to history," Obama says. "Your service belongs to the ages. "We are leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people," the President also says. The return of U.S. soldiers fulfills Obama's campaign pledge in 2008 to end the war. In Iraq, the day is celebrated as "Iraq Day."  February 2012 Tension grows between Iraq's Shiite and Sunni sects. Their blood feud reaches back decades. The Shiites control the central government under Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi is accused of terrorism by the top judicial committee. The body alleges al-Hashimi's security detail carried out 150 attacks between 2005 and 2011. Al-Hashimi dismisses the accusations as politics, noting the judicial committee is controlled by Shiites, and his party threatens to boycott parliament.  March 2012 Some good news, relatively speaking. Violence kills 112 people, the lowest monthly death toll since the U.S-led invasion in 2003, officials say. It's a good sign for the country's ability to maintain security. Iraq also hosts an Arab League summit, a gathering that signals the political emergence of postwar democratic Iraq. But it doesn't last long: By July, violence reaches a nearly two-year peak, with 325 deaths that month.  June 2012 Prime Minister al-Maliki comes under increasing criticism but he survives the threat of a no-confidence vote by parliament. President Jalal Talabani announces that there is not enough support for the vote. Al-Maliki's opponents accuse him of monopolizing power. Later, Osama al-Nujaifi, speaker of parliament, presses efforts to oust al-Maliki and says the Prime Minister will be asked to appear before the governing body.  September 10, 2012 Al-Hashimi, Iraq's top Sunni politician, is given a death sentence in absentia, and he lashes out at the country's top Shiite leader, Prime Minister al-Maliki. Al-Hashimi denies overseeing death squads. "The verdict is unjust, political and illegitimate and I will not acknowledge it," al-Hashimi tells reporters in Ankara, Turkey, where he has been living since fleeing Iraq five months earlier. "To my dear people, I say, make sure that al-Maliki and those who stand behind him don't get what he wishes. Because they want sectarian strife," al-Hashimi says. He remains in exile.  December 31, 2012 The anniversary of the U.S. troops' departure is celebrated as "Day of Sovereignty." But the political climate remains divisive. Days before the anniversary, thousands of Sunnis protest in the streets of Anbar province, a region key to trade with Jordan and Syria, and the Sunnis denounced al-Maliki's order to arrest the bodyguards of Finance Minister Rafaie Esawi, a Sunni. Sunnis and ethnic Kurds accuse al-Maliki and his Shiite political party of cutting them out of the political process, an allegation that comes as U.S. lawmakers raise concerns about Iraq strengthening its ties with Shiite-dominated Iran.  March 2013 Syria, torn by civil war, increasingly loses control of its border with Iraq. Concern looms that Sunni militants on both sides of the border will be capable of challenging governments in both Damascus and Baghdad and control a no-man's land. This foreshadows the rise of ISIS, which began as a splinter group of al Qaeda. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria dreams of creating an Islamic state, or caliphate, across the Sunni areas of Iraq and in Syria. The month also marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S.-led coalition invading Iraq and later ousting authoritarian leader Saddam Hussein.  July 2013 Iraq sees the deadliest month in the last five years since sectarian violence peaked in 2006 and 2007: 1,057 Iraqis are killed and 2,326 more are wounded in acts of terrorism and violence. Al Qaeda in Iraq was declared "on the run" before the U.S. pullout, but now it and other Sunni extremist groups grow stronger as the Shiite-led government fails to bring Sunnis into the political fold. Iraq's Sunni population claims that it is targeted by government forces and grows more alienated and disenfranchised. Al Qaeda in Iraq has expanded into Syria under the umbrella of "Al Qaeda in Iraq and the Levant (Syria)."  January 2014 Questions arise on whether Prime Minister al-Maliki can hold Iraq together against a rising insurgency. ISIS grows. It was known as al Qaeda in Iraq, but now the acronym "ISIS" appears more in news accounts as the militant group seeks to create a single Islamic state in Syria, Iraq and even Lebanon. ISIS continues to exploit a security vacuum across Iraq. It and government troops battle in Ramadi and Falluja -- famous battlegrounds from the days when U.S. forces occupied the country. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says the United States will help the Iraqi government in the battle against al Qaeda-linked fighters in western Iraq, but he stresses that America won't send troops. ISIS fighters are "the most dangerous players in the region," Kerry says.  February 2014 Al Qaeda and ISIS divorce, so to speak. Al Qaeda's central leadership says ISIS "is not a branch of the al Qaeda group." ISIS rejects al Qaeda's leadership. Al Qaeda describes ISIS as too brutal. One thing is clear: the jihadists are infighting.  June 2014 ISIS seizes Mosul in northern Iraq and threatens a march on Baghdad. Another northern city, Samarra, is besieged. A strategic border crossing in the western province of Anbar, the largest geographically in Iraq, falls to ISIS fighters. They also take four small towns. The speed of Iraq's deterioration surprises U.S. officials. Obama says he's prepared to send military advisers to Iraq but not in a combat role.  August 2014 Obama authorizes "targeted airstrikes" against ISIS outposts in northern Iraq as the militants advance to Irbil, known as a regional capital for the country's ethnic Kurds. About 130 Marines and special operations forces are sent to northern Iraq to help tens of thousands of the minority Yazidi people trapped in the mountains by ISIS, who vow to kill them. "Very specifically, this is not a combat boots on the ground operation," U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says. ISIS is "a credible alternative to al Qaeda," a U.S. intelligence official tells CNN. ISIS shocks the world by releasing its first beheading video of an American -- the victim is journalist James Foley -- and threatens the life of another American captive if Obama doesn't end military operations in Iraq. Other beheading videos will follow later. Meanwhile, Prime Minister al-Maliki withdraws his candidacy for a third term as pressure mounts abroad and at home for him to step down. Replacing him will be Haider al-Abadi, who, like al-Maliki, is a member of the Islamic Dawa Party, one of the country's biggest Shiite political blocs.  September 2014 Obama announces the United States will launch airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria, too. The United States underestimated ISIS and overestimated the Iraqis' military will to fight, Obama says. U.S. Secretary of State Kerry adds the expanded military campaign will take time to degrade ISIS. "There's definitely a second day and there will be a third and more. This is going to go on," Kerry says. Several other countries will join the U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.  February 2015 Obama asks Congress to formally authorize the use of the U.S. military in the war against ISIS, but he doesn't call for ground troops in Iraq or Syria.  April 2015 Iraqi forces, joined by Shiite militiamen, enjoy a victory: They retake the city of Tikrit from ISIS.  May 17, 2015 ISIS scores a victory whose symbolism resonates with Americans: After months of clashes with Iraqi and allied forces, ISIS takes control of the key Iraqi city of Ramadi after government security forces pull out of a military base on the west side. The rise and rise of ISIS Ramadi is 70 miles west of Baghdad. </corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Iraq roils in a maelstrom: ISIS now controls Ramadi, a new prime minister is in charge, Shiite-Sunni bloodshed flows, and a U.S.-led coalition is back, this time executing airstrikes in Iraq. The saga of Iraq is, as an analyst put it, "a rather straightforward but sad story" since the U.S. military left the country at the end of 2011, only to find itself returning in a smaller way. The fall of Ramadi to ISIS this week strikes many as a milestone because the city is the capital of Iraq's biggest province and because U.S. troops heroically fought insurgents there in the mid-2000s. Some politicians feel the U.S. withdrawal of troops was a mistake, though public opinion favored it then. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Too late for that now," said Paul Salem of the nonpartisan Middle East Institute. See Interactive Timeline on ISIS's Rise Iraq's problems are bigger than Ramadi: its second largest city, Mosul, is now ISIS' capital, and Iraq still struggles with self-governance, politically and militarily. Here are events since late 2011 that help explain Iraq's ongoing conflict:  December 31, 2011 After almost 4,500 Americans were killed and more than 30,000 injured since 2003 when the United States invaded Iraq, President Barack Obama orders the withdrawal of all troops. The President welcomes them home. "The war in Iraq will soon belong to history," Obama says. "Your service belongs to the ages. "We are leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people," the President also says. The return of U.S. soldiers fulfills Obama's campaign pledge in 2008 to end the war. In Iraq, the day is celebrated as "Iraq Day."  February 2012 Tension grows between Iraq's Shiite and Sunni sects. Their blood feud reaches back decades. The Shiites control the central government under Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi is accused of terrorism by the top judicial committee. The body alleges al-Hashimi's security detail carried out 150 attacks between 2005 and 2011. Al-Hashimi dismisses the accusations as politics, noting the judicial committee is controlled by Shiites, and his party threatens to boycott parliament.  March 2012 Some good news, relatively speaking. Violence kills 112 people, the lowest monthly death toll since the U.S-led invasion in 2003, officials say. It's a good sign for the country's ability to maintain security. Iraq also hosts an Arab League summit, a gathering that signals the political emergence of postwar democratic Iraq. But it doesn't last long: By July, violence reaches a nearly two-year peak, with 325 deaths that month.  June 2012 Prime Minister al-Maliki comes under increasing criticism but he survives the threat of a no-confidence vote by parliament. President Jalal Talabani announces that there is not enough support for the vote. Al-Maliki's opponents accuse him of monopolizing power. Later, Osama al-Nujaifi, speaker of parliament, presses efforts to oust al-Maliki and says the Prime Minister will be asked to appear before the governing body.  September 10, 2012 Al-Hashimi, Iraq's top Sunni politician, is given a death sentence in absentia, and he lashes out at the country's top Shiite leader, Prime Minister al-Maliki. Al-Hashimi denies overseeing death squads. "The verdict is unjust, political and illegitimate and I will not acknowledge it," al-Hashimi tells reporters in Ankara, Turkey, where he has been living since fleeing Iraq five months earlier. "To my dear people, I say, make sure that al-Maliki and those who stand behind him don't get what he wishes. Because they want sectarian strife," al-Hashimi says. He remains in exile.  December 31, 2012 The anniversary of the U.S. troops' departure is celebrated as "Day of Sovereignty." But the political climate remains divisive. Days before the anniversary, thousands of Sunnis protest in the streets of Anbar province, a region key to trade with Jordan and Syria, and the Sunnis denounced al-Maliki's order to arrest the bodyguards of Finance Minister Rafaie Esawi, a Sunni. Sunnis and ethnic Kurds accuse al-Maliki and his Shiite political party of cutting them out of the political process, an allegation that comes as U.S. lawmakers raise concerns about Iraq strengthening its ties with Shiite-dominated Iran.  March 2013 Syria, torn by civil war, increasingly loses control of its border with Iraq. Concern looms that Sunni militants on both sides of the border will be capable of challenging governments in both Damascus and Baghdad and control a no-man's land. This foreshadows the rise of ISIS, which began as a splinter group of al Qaeda. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria dreams of creating an Islamic state, or caliphate, across the Sunni areas of Iraq and in Syria. The month also marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S.-led coalition invading Iraq and later ousting authoritarian leader Saddam Hussein.  July 2013 Iraq sees the deadliest month in the last five years since sectarian violence peaked in 2006 and 2007: 1,057 Iraqis are killed and 2,326 more are wounded in acts of terrorism and violence.

        <titulo>Texas hunter bags rhino on controversial Namibia hunt - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Northern Namibia (CNN)In January 2014, Corey Knowlton bid $350,000 for a permit to hunt and kill a black rhino in Namibia. He won the permit and became a target himself. The hunt is now complete. A rhino is dead. This is how it happened.  Windhoek, Namibia -- Knowlton arrived quietly in Namibia to hunt the famed black rhino. Nearly 18 months ago, the Texas hunter bid $350,000 to kill a black rhinoceros in the southern African country of Namibia. The permit was issued by Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism and auctioned by the Dallas Safari Club. Since then, Knowlton has faced scathing criticism and death threats as the world reacted to the controversial hunt of one of the world's most endangered species. Knowlton has spent the last year and a half preparing and planning the hunt that is being highly scrutinized by animal welfare groups around the world. He agreed to let our CNN crew document the hunt. "At this point, the whole world knows about this hunt and I think it's extremely important that people know it's going down the right way, in the most scientific way that it can possibly happen," Knowlton said after arriving in Africa. Knowlton, 36, from Dallas, wants the world to see that the hunt of such a majestic beast on the African continent is not the work of a bloodthirsty American hunter but a vital component of Namibia's effort to save the animal from extinction. Knowlton's $350,000 will go to fund government anti-poaching efforts across the country. And the killing of an older rhino bull, which no longer contributes to the gene pool but which could harm or kill younger males, is part of the science of conservation, he argues. That's why he says he's doing more to save the black rhino than his critics, and why he wanted us along on this historic hunt. Opponents like the International Fund for Animal Welfare have not been swayed, saying hunting as conservation is a bankrupt notion. "We'll simply never agree with that," fund director Azzedine Downes said. "There's a lot of other things that we can and must do in order to protect these animals." The journey of this hunt will examine the emotional debate raging around the issue of how best to protect endangered species on a continent that is home to some of the most legendary animals on the planet. "I think people have a problem just with the fact that I like to hunt," Knowlton said. "I want to see the black rhino as abundant as it can be. I believe in the survival of the species."  Northern Namibia -- The hunt sets off with a sunrise flight to the region of Namibia where Knowlton will track a black rhino. There's a great deal of concern about news coverage of the hunt in Namibia. We've been told that when our reports are broadcast around the world that Namibian government officials fear poaching syndicates will use the information to identify the location of other black rhinos. For that reason, we have agreed not to report the specific locations of the hunt. According to animal conservationists, there are approximately 5,000 black rhinos in the wild worldwide today, 2,000 of them in Namibia. Hentie van Heerden is a professional hunter hired by the Namibian government to guide Knowlton on the highly scrutinized hunt of the black rhino. Van Heerden, 40, has an international clientele, mostly from Europe, who come to hunt wild game and the exotic animals of Africa. He was born in Namibia and grew up hunting. The thorn-infested terrain in the north of the country does not faze him. He wears sandals even when he hunts the wildest of animals. The bearded van Heerden has the dry sense of humor of a skilled hunter teaching a journalist what to do if we are to stare down a charging rhino. "The aim is to get out of its way without him flattening you," he said. "It's very rare that they come back for seconds and if that is the case, you have to get some more out of its way." Van Heerden says there are a few critics of the black rhino hunt in Namibia, but most people here embrace a culture of hunting. "There will always be activists and that's how they make their money," he said. "They have no clout here in Namibia, because people understand hunting." The hunt is sanctioned and monitored by Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism. It has identified 18 black rhinos across the country that meet the criteria for being hunted and eliminated. The rhino must be an older rhino that is no longer reproducing and is considered a threat to younger, healthier rhinos. Rhinos are intensely territorial and will often kill each other in gruesome fights. Knowlton is targeting one of four black rhinos at the top of the government list, the ones considered "high priority threats to the herd." But identifying these rhinos in the dense brush and in the heat of a dangerous hunt makes Knowlton uneasy, though he will have the help of local trackers and guides. "If it charges at us and we are already sure it's the right one, we are going to kill it," Knowlton said. "If we aren't sure if it's the right one, we are going to try and get out of the way. If we don't feel like we can get out of the way, we got to kill it." That would be the worst-case scenario for Knowlton. For him, the rhino hunt must be carried out flawlessly.  Northern Namibia -- Just after sunrise, Knowlton arrives at a watering hole hidden deep in the Namibian brush to start the hunt. Two government trackers have spotted signs of a rhino heading away from the water. The footprint appears fresh. The weathered wrinkles of the rhino's hide are still visible in the print. The intricate details in the sand suggest the tracks are just a few hours old. The government tracker says, based on the footprints, he can tell this animal is probably one of the black rhinos Knowlton has been permitted to hunt, and that the animal is probably no more than 5 miles away. This is where the hunt begins. The trackers move quickly through the thorny bush and tall grasses. They rarely speak. Quick hand signals are all they need to show the path to follow. Silence is vital when you're tracking a black rhino. The hunting party winds its way through the brush. The rhino's footprints suggests the nearly 3,000 pound (1,360 kilogram) beast is meandering, which tells the hunters it does not feel threatened. As the heat of the day intensifies, rhinos will usually find shady areas to take quick naps. The ranger from the ministry who is observing and leading the trackers says the hunting party is gaining ground on the rhino. But the brush is so dense. Knowlton worries that we could stumble across the rhino at any moment and end up face to face. "I think people think of it as this docile thing," Knowlton said of his prey. "But you are dealing with an extremely athletic animal that can do whatever it wants to you very quickly." The only sounds are the brushes and scrapes of the hunting party cutting through the thorn-infested bushes of this terrain. It seems like every bush has wicked thorns that rip across our skin and clothing. Rhinos have an intense sense of smell and hearing that alerts them to danger from hundreds of yards away. The winds are swirling in the early afternoon hours and the tracker says the rhino can probably sense our presence and is moving away quickly. Knowlton is more concerned with something else. He's been told there are three rhinos known to inhabit the area he's in, but the Namibian government has only authorized the hunting of two of them. Visibility in the brush around us is down to about 15 feet (4.6 meters.) Knowlton is worried that if the rhino charges through the thick brush that he would only have a split second to decide whether to take the shot. It's becoming too risky. We've spent five hours trekking nearly 6 miles through the brush when Knowlton and his hunting partner decide to call it a day. Killing the wrong rhino, Knowlton said, would be a catastrophic mistake. Last year, one of Knowlton's critics suggested the trophy hunting of a black rhino was like shooting a couch in a living room. This criticism annoys Knowlton endlessly. He's quick to bring it up with a heavy dose of sarcasm. "So this is just like hunting a couch? Give me a break," he said. "This isn't easy. It's brutal."  On the road to southern Namibia -- Knowlton decides the hunt in the north is too treacherous. The brush is dense and visibility low. That's a dangerous combination for the hunting party and Knowlton knows that killing the wrong rhino will make him an even bigger target of international outrage. He and his hunting guide decide to drive to southern Namibia to target another dangerous black rhino that lives in a region with better visibility. But on the way we hear that rhino has died, probably of natural causes.  Northern Namibia -- Knowlton returns to the region that makes him the most nervous. And on this morning, the trails are not strong. The trackers have trouble finding prints leading away from the watering holes where the rhinos drink vast amounts of water. It's clear the rhino hunt will not end today.  Northern Namibia -- The morning starts with a startling discovery. Knowlton's professional hunting guide has discovered a camera image showing a rhino at a remote watering hole just before sunrise. The image is stunning. The rhino is more massive than I expected. Its horn is long with a lethal pointed tip. Knowlton spots a large gash in the rhino's ear. It's a crucial identifying mark that tells him instantly this rhino is on the approved government list to be hunted. The hunting party quickly picks up the tracks and disappears into the vicious African bush. The rhino footprints are fresh and light on the sand, telling the trackers the animal is slowly walking, eating grass and taking naps in the shade to avoid the rising sun. Today feels different. There's a sense that just beyond our view we are close to the rhino. The hunting party stops to drink water in the shade of a tree for 20 minutes. When the tracking resumes, Knowlton discovers the spot where the rhino had been resting not moments earlier. You can see the imprint of its wrinkled hide still fresh on the sandy ground. The rhino is close. Knowlton's hands firmly grip his high-powered 500 Nitro Express rifle. Moments later, I see a massive flash of gray leap up over the bushes some 50 feet in front of us. It disappears and you can't tell which direction the rhino is running. It's jarring to see this close how quickly these massive creatures can move. I remember the advice van Heerden, the professional hunting guide, gave me the day before. "You can't outrun the rhino," he said. "If it means to dive into a thorn bush to the left or to the right, we need to get out of its way in a big hurry." Now we can't see the rhino, but we know it's close. Van Heerden tells Knowlton, "He's angry. The next time he will charge." Twenty minutes later as the hunting party moves through the brush, I hear a sound I've not heard before during our trek. The rhino is moving around but it's invisible. It's impossible to grasp how such a beast can move like a ghost in the brush. The hunting party moves single file through a tree line. As the last member of the group emerges, he looks to his left and no more than 40 feet away the rhino is there, staring straight at us. "There it is!" says the last member in the group. It's a breathtaking sight. But this isn't the time to stand and stare. I cut to one side and the rhino starts charging in my direction. "Ed! Get down!" shouts van Heerden. I rush behind Knowlton and his hunting guide. "As soon as you dropped below my gun, I could see the whole animal right behind you," Knowlton would tell me later. I turn around and for a quick flash only see the top half of the rhino in front of us. Then four shots explode through the air. The rhino has been hit at least three times. The hunting party then makes the final push to find the rhino. I've lost track of time. This last push might have taken 30 minutes, it might have taken an hour. It was an incredibly emotional experience. A tracker climbs into a tree and spots the rhino in an open field about 100 yards away. Knowlton gets into position and fires the final shots. The black rhino is dead. Knowlton walks up from behind the rhino and when he's certain it's over, he kneels next to it. "Any time you take an animal's life it's an emotional thing," Knowlton said. The Namibian government official assures Knowlton it is the rhino on the approved hunting list. The trackers smile with relief and shake hands. I ask Knowlton if he still feels that killing this black rhino was the right thing to do and that it will benefit the future of this endangered species. "I felt like from day one it was something benefiting the black rhino," Knowlton reflected just moments after the hunt ended. "Being on this hunt, with the amount of criticism it brought and the amount of praise it brought from both sides, I don't think it could have brought more awareness to the black rhino."

        <titulo>Traitors no more? North Korean defectors 'forgiven' - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN)Kkot-jebi -- literally "flower swallows" -- sounds poetic, but the reality is much harsher. The North Korean term refers to homeless children, fending for themselves without the support of family or state. The word traces it roots back to the aftermath of the Korean War, an imaginative pronunciation of the Russian word "kochevyi," meaning "wandering," and referring to those displaced by the 1950-53 conflict. During the 1990s, North Korea was hit by several years of famine as disastrous harvests laid waste to the land, killing hundreds of thousands, according to conservative estimates. The country's social safety net was reduced to tatters. Families fell apart. And flower swallows re-emerged in large numbers. Although conditions today are much better, North Korea remains desperately poor. Food is in short supply for a large portion of the population -- and kkot-jebi are still very much in existence.  North Korea is one of the most secretive societies in the world. When a CNN team recently visited, our entire schedule was arranged by our official government hosts. Our "minders" accompanied us on every shoot. We had put in certain requests, but we never knew more than a few hours in advance what the next item on our itinerary would be. When we were told to go to a meeting room at our hotel one afternoon, we had no idea who was going to be behind the doors, just something to do with the reality of defectors. When we walked through the doors and saw eight young people sitting on one side of a huge round conference table, we immediately knew who we were to meet.  In early summer 2013, the world's media cried foul over the repatriation of a group of nine North Korea children, then aged between 14 and 19, from Laos. They had been picked up by border security as they were being smuggled from China into Laos by South Korean missionaries, in the hope of getting them resettled in South Korea. READ: Agonizingly close to freedom Pyongyang is not shy about its hatred of defectors. It refers to them in official media as "human scum" and accuses them of criminal acts, lying about their own country for fame and money and abandoning their own families. The decision to return the children was widely condemned. Dire predictions were made about their fate: The children were being sent back to prison; they would face a lifetime of retribution and could even be executed. But here in this room, nearly two years after their return, these former kkot-jebi appear transformed. Four young men dressed in the blue blazers of university students and two boys and two girls in secondary school uniforms, all sat waiting to answer our questions. The ninth member of the group was in a university further away from Pyongyang and could not be brought in at short notice.  They were all children between the ages of 12 and 17 when they crossed into China, separately or in small groups. They only met after they arrived at the missionaries' house. We asked why they left -- it was an uncomfortable opening question. "We were young," said 17-year-old Ri Gwang Hyok. "We just went to China for fun." Pressed for more detail, Mun Chol, 21, admitted: "Frankly, we had some family difficulties. We had been through a period in our history we call 'the arduous march (the years of famine).' We were not living well. I was young and naive. We were living by the Amnok river, which is at the border. I meant to return home. I was curious." We then asked how many of them had experienced hunger before they left. Four of the eight raised their hands. "It was winter. We had preserved food during autumn. But it wasn't enough. Our family was too large," explained Pak Kwang Hyok, 19. Once in China, the children were brought to a house in the border town of Dandong, looked after by a South Korean missionary CNN has called M.J. in previous reports, along with his wife. There, according to M.J., the starving children were transformed. According to the youngsters now, the picture was not so rosy. They said they were kept in the house for a year and a half. "The missionary lectured us about freedom," recalled Mun Chol. "But we weren't given any freedom. He forced us to study God and memorize religious books. "Of course, the food was good," he added, "but that was our only pleasure. When you have food things seem OK, but a kid needs more than that." Following our encounter with the students, CNN contacted M.J., who asked about their well-being. He says he misses them. While hesitant to say much out of fear for their safety, he insists the students needed his help after fleeing North Korea.  China is a historical ally of North Korea, and North Koreans found illegally in the country face deportation if caught. After a year and a half, the missionary decided to move the children to a third country. He chose Laos, on China's southwestern border, from where he hoped he could get them to South Korea. After a harrowing night trek for four hours through the hilly border region, the party were picked up by Laotian police and detained. When they were told they would be sent back to North Korea they were terrified. "The missionary said we would be killed if we went back," said Mun Chol. "He told us our families had been killed because we had left our homes."  But instead of being punished, they tell us they received special treatment, extra tuition to make up for three years of missed schooling, and are now studying in the best educational establishments in the capital. "I was scared," admitted Pak Gwang Hyok. "I had left my home with a guilty conscience and spent time abroad. We had betrayed our country. I thought we would be punished. But now we are studying in the best universities in Pyongyang. Our fears were pretty foolish." Soon after their return, the children appeared on North Korean television to denounce their enticement to defect by South Koreans. Now , more than a year later, they are again on display. They have become poster children for the "benevolence and forgiveness" of the North Korean authorities. There is a huge difference between their lives when they left for China and now. "I feel like a pauper who has become a prince," said Ri Gwang Hyok. But their families have not joined them in Pyongyang, the showcase capital. They remain in the poor border areas and their lives have not changed. When he thinks about what might have happened if he had made it to South Korea, Mun Chol said, "If I had made it, I could have become a traitor -- a bad guy who deserts his family. "I could have gone down in history as one of the 'scum of the earth.'" READ: North Korean: I felt like a slave in Kuwait </corpo>
